## Executive Summary

JusticeHub offers **three investment levels** to match Mindaroo's appetite and strategic priorities. Each scenario represents a viable, well-planned approach with different levels of ambition across community engagement, platform development, and systems change.

> **Key Principle:** All scenarios value Indigenous knowledge properly, build community capacity, and create pathways to sustainability. The difference is in scale and speed of impact.

### Quick Comparison

| Scenario | 3-Year Total | Communities | Indigenous Developers | Platform Quality | Recommended For |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **LEAN** | **$5.9M** | 4 | 2 trainees → paid staff | Basic, functional | Testing the model with lower risk |
| **BASE** ⭐ | **$10.5M** | 6 | 4 trainees → paid staff | Quality, community-ready | **Meaningful systems change (RECOMMENDED)** |
| **UPPER** | **$17.6M** | 10 | 6 trainees → paid staff | Advanced, feature-rich | Comprehensive transformation |

---

## Pre-Budget: Value Already Created

**Before any Mindaroo investment, JusticeHub has already delivered $303K in value:**

| What's Been Done | Value | Why This Matters |
|------------------|-------|------------------|
| **Working Platform Built** | $183K | Next.js application, Supabase backend, program directory, story library, admin interfaces - not starting from scratch |
| **Content & Research** | $57K | 15+ programs documented, 8-10 community stories gathered, international excellence map research completed |
| **Community Relationships** | $30K | Initial engagement with Oonchiumpa (Alice Springs), Bourke, Moree - trust foundation established |
| **Strategic Planning** | $33K | This comprehensive budget framework, pitch documents, partnership models - clear direction |
| **TOTAL VALUE** | **$303K** | **Mindaroo invests in proven concept with momentum, not untested idea** |

> **What this means:** You're not funding a startup idea. You're scaling an operational platform with proven community relationships and clear strategic direction.

## Community Payment Model (All Scenarios)

All scenarios use a **simple, transparent "pay-per-engagement" model** with three components:

> **💡 Example:** A community in the BASE scenario receives approximately **$120K per year** through the combination of partnership fee ($80K) + knowledge holder sessions ($16-20K) + content bounties ($20-40K). This values Indigenous knowledge at consultant rates.

### 1️⃣ Annual Partnership Fee

**One payment per community per year covering base engagement:**

- Local community coordinator retainer (paid monthly)
- Monthly check-ins and relationship management
- Basic equipment and technology support
- Cultural protocol costs
- Administrative coordination

| Scenario | Partnership Fee per Community | What Community Gets |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **LEAN** | $60K/year | Part-time coordinator (1-2 days/week), basic support |
| **BASE** | $80K/year | Regular coordinator (2 days/week), solid support |
| **UPPER** | $100K/year | Strong coordinator (3 days/week), comprehensive support |

### 2️⃣ Knowledge Holder Session Fees

**Separate per-session payments directly to Elders, cultural practitioners, and program experts:**

| Scenario | Rate per Session | Logic | Typical Sessions/Year |
|----------|------------------|-------|----------------------|
| **LEAN** | $750 | $150/hour × 5 hours | 16 sessions |
| **BASE** | $1,000 | $200/hour × 5 hours | 16-20 sessions |
| **UPPER** | $1,200 | $240/hour × 5 hours | 20-24 sessions |

> **Why separate from partnership fee?** Makes compensation transparent. Individual knowledge holders see exactly what they're paid for their expertise.

### 3️⃣ Content Creation Bounties

**Pay-per-piece for specific deliverables:**

| Content Type | LEAN | BASE | UPPER | What's Included |
|--------------|------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Video story** (community-produced) | $2,000 | $2,500 | $3,000 | Filming, editing, cultural review, permissions |
| **Written story** | $500 | $600 | $750 | Interviews, writing, editing, cultural protocols |
| **Program documentation** | $800 | $1,000 | $1,200 | Full program write-up with implementation guide |
| **Podcast interview** | $400 | $500 | $600 | Recording, editing, transcript |

> **Why bounties?** Communities control how much they engage. More content = more payment. Aligns incentives and ensures value-for-money.

> **💡 See Example:** Visit the [Stories page](/stories) to see published stories that communities would be paid to create. Each story includes video/audio, transcript, and cultural context—representing the quality we're funding.

## Years 2 & 3 Summary

> **💡 Key Insight:** Watch how Indigenous trainees progress from learning (Year 1) → advancing (Year 2) → becoming paid staff replacing the Tech Lead (Year 3). This is systems change in action.

### Key Changes Over Time

**Year 1 → Year 2:**

- ✅ **Indigenous trainees scale up:** LEAN stays at 2; BASE grows to 4; UPPER grows to 5
- ✅ **Business Development role added** (0.5 FTE in BASE/UPPER) to build revenue streams
- ✅ **Platform moves from build to enhancement** (costs reduce)
- ✅ **Tech Lead reduces** as trainees advance (0.75→0.5 FTE in BASE)
- ✅ **UPPER scales to 8 communities** (from 6)

**Year 2 → Year 3:**

- ✅ **TRAINEES BECOME PAID STAFF:** 2-6 Indigenous developers employed
- ✅ **Tech Lead eliminated** in BASE/UPPER (Indigenous developers now lead platform)

## Cost Per Community Analysis

> **💡 Value for Money:** The question isn't "how much per community?" but "what does each community get for that investment?" See the detailed breakdown below.

Understanding the value-for-money in each scenario:

### 3-Year Investment Per Community

| Scenario | Total 3-Year Budget | Communities Engaged | Cost Per Community | What Each Community Gets Over 3 Years |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **LEAN** | $5.9M | 4 | **$1.48M** | $433K direct payments + share of platform, training, governance |
| **BASE** | $10.5M | 6 | **$1.75M** | $587K direct payments + share of platform, training, governance, international learning |
| **UPPER** | $17.6M | 10 (avg 8) | **$2.20M** | $684K direct payments + share of advanced platform, comprehensive training, global connections |

### What "Direct Payments" Include (BASE Example)

| Component | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | 3-Year Total Per Community |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| Partnership Fee | $80K | $80K | $80K | $240K |
| Knowledge Holder Sessions | $16K | $20K | $24K | $60K |
| Content Bounties | $25K | $35K | $40K | $100K |
| Share of gatherings | $8K | $12K | $15K | $35K |
| Share of governance | $12K | $24K | $30K | $66K |
| Share of evaluation | $3K | $8K | $13K | $24K |
| Equipment & contingency | $19K | $21K | $23K | $63K |
| **TOTAL** | **$163K** | **$200K** | **$225K** | **$588K** |

> **Is $588K per community over 3 years fair?** This averages to $196K per year for deep partnership, not token engagement.

<div align="right"><a href="#-table-of-contents">↑ Back to top</a></div>

## Indigenous Capacity Building Journey

> **💡 Real-World Example:** In BASE scenario, 2 Indigenous trainees start in Year 1 at $36K/year learning web development. By Year 2, they've proven themselves and we bring in 2 more trainees (now 4 total). By Year 3, all 4 are employed as paid developers at $45K part-time, and the $112K Tech Lead role is eliminated. The platform is now Indigenous-led.

### Trainee to Employment Pathway

| | LEAN | BASE ⭐ | UPPER |
|--|------|---------|-------|
| **Year 1** | 2 trainees @ $30K/year ($2,500/month) | 2 trainees @ $36K/year ($3,000/month) | 3 trainees @ $40K/year ($3,333/month) |
| **Year 2** | 2 trainees @ $33K/year | **4 trainees** @ $36K/year | **5 trainees** @ $40K/year |
| **Year 3** | **2 PAID STAFF** @ $40K each (part-time) | **4 PAID STAFF** @ $45K each (part-time) | **6 PAID STAFF** @ $50K each (part-time) |

### Tech Lead Reduction (Cost Savings)

| Year | LEAN | BASE | UPPER |
|------|------|------|-------|
| **Year 1** | 0.5 FTE ($75K) | 0.75 FTE ($112K) | 1.0 FTE ($150K) |
| **Year 2** | 0.5 FTE ($75K) | **0.5 FTE ($75K)** | 0.75 FTE ($112K) |
| **Year 3** | **0.25 FTE ($38K)** | **ELIMINATED ($0)** | **ELIMINATED ($0)** |
| **Total 3-Year Cost** | $188K | $187K | $262K |
| **Indigenous Staff Investment** | $209K | $471K | $783K |

> **Key Insight:** By Year 3, BASE and UPPER have eliminated the $100K+ Tech Lead role by investing in Indigenous developers. This is systems change in action.

<div align="right"><a href="#-table-of-contents">↑ Back to top</a></div>

## Platform Investment Evolution

> **💡 Cost Reduction Example:** In BASE scenario, platform costs drop from $500K (Year 1 build) → $270K (Year 2 enhancements) → $200K (Year 3 maintenance). Why? Indigenous developers have taken over from the external Tech Lead. That's a $300K annual saving by Year 3.

| Year | LEAN | BASE | UPPER | What's Happening |
|------|------|------|-------|------------------|
| **Year 1** | $307K (basic build) | $500K (quality build) | $715K (advanced features) | Building the foundation |
| **Year 2** | $155K (basic enhancements) | $270K (quality enhancements) | $455K (advanced features) | Adding capabilities |
| **Year 3** | $100K (maintenance only) | $200K (maintenance, Indigenous-led) | $350K (maintenance + minor features) | Indigenous developers leading |
| **Total 3-Year** | $562K | $970K | $1,520K | |

### Platform Development Costs Reduce Over Time

**Why costs drop in Year 3:**

1. Platform built and tested in Years 1-2
2. Indigenous developers now leading (not expensive external contractors)
3. Maintenance only (not major feature development)
4. Community ownership transition reduces ongoing ACT costs

## Sustainability & Revenue Trajectory

> **💡 Revenue Reality Check:** By Year 3 in BASE scenario, we project $60K revenue (just 1.5% self-sustaining). This is honest. By Year 7, we estimate $300-400K revenue (12-15% self-sustaining). Social enterprises take time to build trust and revenue streams. We're not over-promising.

### Year 3 Revenue (First Income!)

| Scenario | Revenue Sources | Year 3 Revenue | % Self-Sustaining |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **LEAN** | 10-12 org memberships @ $2.5K avg + small training contracts | $30K | 1.4% |
| **BASE** | 15-20 org memberships + pilot government training + consulting | $60K | 1.5% |
| **UPPER** | 25-30 org memberships + established training contracts + premium consulting | $100K | 1.4% |

### 7-Year Sustainability Pathway (BASE Example)

| Year | Revenue | Philanthropic Need | % Self-Sustaining | Revenue Sources |
|------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Year 1-2 | $0 | $6.7M (total) | 0% | Building foundation, proving value |
| **Year 3** | **$60K** | **$3.8M** | **1.5%** | **First memberships and pilot contracts** |
| Year 4 | $150-200K | $2.8-3.2M | 5-7% | Established memberships (35-50 orgs), growing training |
| Year 5 | $300-400K | $2.3-2.6M | 12-15% | Government training contracts secured, premium content |
| Year 6 | $500-700K | $1.8-2.2M | 22-28% | Diversified revenue, international licensing begins |
| Year 7 | $800K-1.0M | $1.5-1.8M | 35-40% | Multiple revenue streams mature |
| Year 8-10 | $1.0-1.5M | $1.0-1.5M | 50-60% | Approaching sustainability |

> **Reality Check:** Social enterprises take 7-10 years to reach 50-70% self-sustaining. Government training contracts take 18-24 months from first conversation to signed agreement. This timeline is realistic, not over-promising.

## Decision Gates & Risk Mitigation

> **💡 Smart Funding:** Rather than committing all $10.5M upfront, Mindaroo can use three decision gates (Year 1, mid-Year 2, end-Year 3) to review progress and decide whether to continue, adjust, or exit. This manages risk.

### Recommended Mindaroo Decision Points

**Gate 1: After Year 1 (12 months)**

- **Review:** Platform quality, community engagement depth, trainee progress, evaluation data
- **Decision:** Proceed to Year 2 at planned scale? Adjust? Exit?

  - 2 trainees progressing well with measurable skills development
  - Community satisfaction >80% (measured through evaluation)
  - Advisory Council functioning effectively

**Gate 2: Mid-Year 2 (18 months total)**

- **Review:** Mid-term evaluation results, community capacity growth, revenue potential, trainee advancement to 4 people
- **Decision:** Proceed to Year 3 transition phase? Extend Year 2 approach? Scale down?
- **Success criteria:**
  - 4 trainees advancing with demonstrated platform contribution
  - Community Governance Board taking shape
  - First revenue contracts in pipeline

## Frequently Asked Questions

> **💡 Quick Reference:** Jump to the questions most relevant to your concerns. Each answer includes context and rationale.

### About Community Payments

**Q: Is $80K per year enough to make it "worth their time" for communities?**

A: In BASE, communities receive approximately $120K per year when you include partnership fee ($80K) + knowledge holder sessions ($16-20K) + content bounties ($20-40K). This is substantial compensation that values Indigenous knowledge at consultant rates.

**Q: How do knowledge holders actually receive payment?**

A: Payments go directly to individuals or are managed through community-controlled organisations. Each community decides their own payment distribution model. The partnership fee goes to the community organisation; session fees and content bounties can go directly to individuals.

**Q: What if a community wants to engage more/less than budgeted?**

A: The pay-per-engagement model is flexible. Communities can do more sessions or create more content and receive additional payment. Conversely, if life circumstances require reduced engagement, they're not penalized - they simply do fewer paid sessions.

### About Indigenous Trainees

**Q: Why only 2 trainees in Year 1 for BASE?**

A: Starting with 2 allows proper mentorship and curriculum development. Quality over quantity. We scale to 4 in Year 2 once the training program is proven and running smoothly.

**Q: Is $3,000 per month livable?**

A: In BASE, trainees receive $36K annually ($3K/month) which is above minimum wage and allows focused learning without financial stress. This increases in Year 2-3 before transitioning to paid employment at $45K part-time.

**Q: What happens if trainees don't complete the program?**

A: The program is designed for success with strong mentorship, cultural support, and clear progression. If someone needs to leave, we recruit replacement trainees. The budget includes some buffer for this contingency.

### About Platform & Technology

**Q: Can you really build a quality platform for $500K?**

A: Yes. We're building on existing foundation ($183K already invested). $500K for 12 months gets you solid Next.js platform, proper UX, security compliance, and testing. We're not building Facebook - we're building a focused program directory and story library with Indigenous data sovereignty.

**Q: What if platform costs more than budgeted?**

A: Each scenario has operational contingency (5-7%). Platform work is phased - if costs increase, we reduce scope in Year 1 and continue in Year 2. The budget is realistic based on actual development costs.

**Q: Why does UPPER cost more for platform?**

A: UPPER includes advanced features (AI-powered matching, custom dashboards), PWA for offline capability, more extensive security testing, and professional UX research with all communities. BASE gets you quality; UPPER gets you excellence.

### About A Curious Tractor Fee

**Q: Why does ACT get 8% fee?**

A: This covers ACT's organisational costs to deliver a complex multi-community project: senior project management, financial compliance, governance oversight, risk management, HR support, and organisational infrastructure. 8% is standard for nonprofit complex project management.

**Q: Is this fee negotiable?**

A: The 8% is calculated based on ACT's actual costs to sustainably deliver this work. Going lower risks ACT's organisational sustainability and delivery quality. The fee is transparent and consistent across all scenarios.

**Q: What happens to ACT fee when project transitions to community ownership?**

A: By Year 3-4, ACT transitions from owner/operator to fee-for-service provider. The community-owned organisation may continue contracting ACT for specific services, or may hire their own staff, or may use other providers. ACT doesn't lock in dependency.

### About Sustainability

**Q: Why does revenue take so long to grow?**

A: Social enterprises need 2-3 years to prove value before organisations pay for memberships or training. Government training contracts take 18-24 months from first conversation to signed agreement. We're being realistic, not over-promising quick sustainability.

**Q: What if revenue grows faster than projected?**

A: Great! Faster revenue means less philanthropic dependency. Excess revenue goes to the Community Investment Fund to support community-led projects. Revenue projections are conservative - we may exceed them.

**Q: Is 50-70% self-sustaining realistic for a social impact organisation?**

A: Yes, but it takes 7-10 years. Many successful social enterprises operate at 50-70% earned income with some philanthropic funding for innovation and community programs. 100% self-sustaining often means compromising community-first mission for commercial viability.
