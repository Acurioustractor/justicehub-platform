## 💡 Cost Per Impact

### Understanding Value for Money

**Cost Per User Engaged (Year 1):**
- Foundation Budget: $960K ÷ 500 users = **$1,920 per user**
- Comprehensive: $1.43M ÷ 800 users = **$1,788 per user**

**Cost Per Story/Resource Created (Year 1):**
- Foundation: $220K ÷ 70 pieces = **$3,143 per piece**
- Comprehensive: $220K ÷ 70 pieces = **$3,143 per piece**

**Cost Per Practitioner Reached Locally (Year 1):**
- 4 pilot sites: $355K ÷ 200 practitioners = **$1,775 per practitioner**

**Cost Per Young Person Potentially Impacted:**
- If 200 practitioners each work with 10 young people
- $355K ÷ 2,000 young people = **$178 per young person**
- Compare to: Cost of youth detention ($1,000-2,000/day)

## 📊 Minimal vs Foundation vs Comprehensive

### What You Get at Each Level

| Element | Minimal ($280K) | Foundation ($960K) ⭐ | Comprehensive ($1.43M) |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Project Management** | Part-time (0.3 FTE) | Full Director (1.0 FTE) | Director + Ops (1.5 FTE) |
| **Content Team** | 1 person part-time | 2.5 FTE team | 2.5 FTE team |
| **Stories/Year** | 15-20 | 40-50 | 40-50 |
| **Program Profiles** | 10 | 20-25 | 45-50 (with CoE) |
| **Local Leaders** | 0 | 4 pilot sites | 4 pilot sites |
| **Events** | Online only (6-8) | Blended (25+ events) | Blended (25+ events) |
| **Centre of Excellence** | None | None | Active hub |
| **Evidence Syntheses** | 0 | 0 | 4-6 per year |
| **Users Reached** | 100-200 | 500-800 | 800-1,200 |
| **Impact Potential** | Low (awareness) | Medium (engagement) | High (transformation) |
| **Sustainability Risk** | HIGH ⚠️ | MEDIUM | LOW ✅ |

### Minimal Budget Risks ⚠️

**Why We Don't Recommend:**
- Too small to demonstrate impact
- Quality compromised by under-resourcing
- Team burnout likely
- No local engagement (platform remains abstract)
- Won't attract or retain users
- Difficult to secure future funding without results
- **High risk of failure**

### Foundation Budget: The Sweet Spot ⭐

**Why This Works:**
- Sufficient resources for quality
- Tests key elements (content, local, events)
- Manageable scale for learning
- Demonstrates impact for future funding
- Sustainable team workload
- Community-led possible at this scale
- **Balanced risk/reward**

### Comprehensive: If Funding Available ✅

**When to Choose:**
- Funding secured upfront
- Urgency for rapid results
- Strong partnerships committed
- CoE deemed essential by community
- Resources available for quality at scale

## 🎨 Budget Flexibility

### Where You Can Save

**If Budget Tight:**
1. **Defer CoE** (-$470K)
   - Start with foundation, add in Year 2
   - Focus on content and local leadership first

2. **Reduce Local Sites** (-$90K per site)
   - Start with 2-3 sites instead of 4
   - Pilot in diverse contexts, expand when proven

3. **Scale Back Events** (-$100K)
   - Focus on online webinars and 1-2 major events
   - Build up as community grows

4. **Part-time Positions** (-$50-100K)
   - Some roles at 0.5-0.8 FTE initially
   - Increase as workload demands

**Minimum Viable Budget: $680K**
```
Project Management (0.8 FTE)        $95K
Content Development (1.5 FTE)       $150K
Local Leadership (2 sites)          $180K
Workshops & Forums (online focus)   $120K
Contingency (10%)                   $55K
────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                              $600K
WITH CONTINGENCY:                   $655K
```

⚠️ **Caution:** Below $680K, quality and impact seriously compromised

### Where You Shouldn't Save

**Do Not Cut:**
1. **Community Payments** - Ethical obligation to pay storytellers
2. **Cultural Safety** - Essential for Aboriginal engagement
3. **Youth Involvement** - Young people must be paid for participation
4. **Evaluation** - Need evidence for future funding
5. **Project Management** - Without coordination, nothing works
