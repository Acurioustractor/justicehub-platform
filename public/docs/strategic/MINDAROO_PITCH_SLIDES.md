## SLIDE 2: The Problem

# **Communities Trapped in Dependency Cycles**

**The Current Reality:**
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are still around **17× more likely** to be in detention on an average night[^1]
- Community-led programmes delivering better outcomes stay **local and under-resourced**
- Knowledge is often **extracted** without community control or compensation
- Short funding cycles mean programmes **shut down before they can scale**

**The Cost:**
- Systems keep paying **$1,500+ per young person per day** for detention instead of prevention
- Sector actors keep **duplicating effort** because proven solutions remain siloed
- Communities are exhausted by **consultation without action** while young people cycle through punitive systems

---

## SLIDE 3: Our Solution

# **Community Ownership + Economic Self-Determination**

**What We're Building:**
1. **Community-Owned Platform** - Not "community-led," actually owned by communities
2. **Economic Self-Determination** - Revenue streams, not perpetual grants
3. **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** - Layered consent, Australian hosting, legal trust deed enforcement
4. **Break Dependency Cycles** - Financial independence by Year 5
5. **Inclusive Infrastructure** - CALD, remote, disability, LGBTQIA+ partners use the same consent-led framework
6. **Global Leadership** - Australia as world leader in Indigenous-led justice

**This Is Different:**
- ✅ Seed capital for **permanent infrastructure**
- ✅ Costs **reducing over time** through community capacity
- ✅ **Time-limited partnership** (3-5 years), not ongoing dependency
- ✅ Platform **legally transfers** to communities by Year 5
- ✅ Independent cybersecurity audits and safeguarding frameworks from Day 1

## SLIDE 13: Strategic Alignment with Mindaroo

# **Youth Justice **AND** Early Childhood Prevention**

**The 0-5 Connection:**
- **Intergenerational trauma prevention** - Supporting youth today prevents trauma for tomorrow's children
- **Longitudinal evidence** - Track which 0-5 programmes prevent later justice involvement
- **Family-centred approaches** - Communities support whole families across life course
- **Prevention ROI** - Platform enables cost-benefit analysis for early intervention

**But Also:**
- Youth justice impact is **primary driver**
- Project stands on its own merit
- 0-5 connection is **strategic bonus**, not foundation

---

## SLIDE 14: What Makes This Different

# **Transformational, Not Transactional Philanthropy**

**Traditional Model:**
- Ongoing programme funding
- Dependency on external organisations
- Costs stay same or increase
- No exit strategy

**JusticeHub Model:**
- ✅ **Seed capital** for permanent infrastructure
- ✅ **Costs reducing** through community capacity (20-26% by Year 3)
- ✅ **Revenue generation** - communities earning income
- ✅ **Community ownership** - legal transfer by Year 5
- ✅ **Clear exit** - A Curious Tractor transitions to service provider, not owner

**Your investment creates something that:**
- Exists **forever**
- Is **owned by communities**
- Generates **sustainable revenue**
- Reduces **sector's philanthropic dependency**

## SLIDE 17: Risk Mitigation

# **How We Address Key Risks**

**Risk: Community Consultation Fatigue**
→ **Mitigation:** Pay properly, show early wins, decision-making power to communities

**Risk: Technology Adoption**
→ **Mitigation:** Mobile-first design, offline capability, in-person support

**Risk: Funding Sustainability**
→ **Mitigation:** Diversified revenue from Year 1, conservative projections, community capacity building

**Risk: Cultural Appropriation**
→ **Mitigation:** First Nations Advisory Council controls all cultural protocols, communities own content

**Risk: Cybersecurity & Privacy**
→ **Mitigation:** ISO-aligned Australian hosting, MFA, annual penetration tests, 24-hour breach response protocol

**Risk: Safeguarding & Duty of Care**
→ **Mitigation:** Trauma-informed practice training, clinical supervision, clear escalation pathways for disclosures, proactive content moderation

**Risk: Misalignment with Mindaroo**
→ **Mitigation:** Clear 0-5 connection articulated, regular reporting, flexibility to adapt
