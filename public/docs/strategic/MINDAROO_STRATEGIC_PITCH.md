## Executive Summary

JusticeHub is a community-owned digital intelligence platform serving **all young people** in Australia's youth justice system. Built under **Indigenous leadership** and governed by Indigenous data sovereignty principles, the platform creates sector-wide infrastructure for documenting, fairly compensating, and scaling culturally-grounded practice across Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities. Led by A Curious Tractor in partnership with First Nations advisors and pilot communities, JusticeHub will build community capacity to own and govern the platform by Year 5. We ask Mindaroo for a 3-year investment of **$9.5M–$13.0M (recommended Level 2)** to deliver a robust MVP in 6 communities (starting with Indigenous due to 17x overrepresentation), train Indigenous technologists and storytellers, pilot revenue models, and establish the legal, technical and governance foundations for a community-owned ACCO. The approach is time-limited, measurable, and designed to shift power and economic value back to communities while creating a durable pathway to financial self-determination for the entire sector.

**Investment Transparency:** This budget includes substantial direct payments to communities ($1.08M annually for 6 communities at $180K each) ensuring proper compensation for Indigenous knowledge and cultural intelligence at consultant rates, not token stipends. It also includes explicit A Curious Tractor organizational capacity ($320-395K annually, ~11-12% overhead) to ensure sustainable project management, financial compliance, and risk management—this is a complex systems-change initiative requiring dedicated infrastructure.

**Strategic Alignment with Mindaroo:** While youth justice is our core focus, this work contributes to Mindaroo's early childhood prevention priorities—supporting young people today prevents intergenerational trauma for tomorrow's children. Longitudinal tracking will demonstrate which 0-5 interventions reduce later justice involvement. This connection is significant, but youth justice impact is the primary driver.

**Why This Is Different:**
- **Sector-wide infrastructure** — Serves all young people with Indigenous governance setting the gold standard for consent, sovereignty, and community control
- **True community ownership** — Platform legally transfers to community-governed ACCO by Year 5, not perpetual external control
- **Economic self-determination** — Revenue streams break philanthropic dependency (target 30-75% self-sustaining by Year 5)
- **Indigenous data sovereignty protects everyone** — Framework developed for Indigenous communities becomes best practice for CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities
- **Fair compensation for all communities** — Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, LGBTQIA+ communities compensated equally ($180K annually)
- **Capacity building reduces costs** — Young Indigenous developers and content creators replace external contractors (20-26% cost reduction by Year 3)
- **Time-limited seed capital** — Not ongoing programme funding; building permanent sector infrastructure
- **Measurable transition gates** — Clear readiness criteria for community ownership (detailed in Section 6)

**The Ask:** $9.5M–$13.0M over 3 years (Level 2 - Foundational Excellence) with phased decision gates and independent evaluation

## Part 1: The Strategic Case

### Why JusticeHub Matters

**The Core Problem: Power, Knowledge, and Perpetual Dependency**

**Every young person** in Australia's youth justice system deserves better. The crisis is most acute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people—**17 times more likely** to be in detention—but the knowledge to change this exists across all communities: Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities. Yet this frontline intelligence is held inside community-led programs that rarely move beyond the places where they were born. Short grant cycles, fragmented systems, and extractive research practices keep proven solutions invisible across the sector, so we keep duplicating effort instead of scaling what already works. Intellectual property and cultural intelligence continue to be extracted without compensation or community control, while frontline organisations shoulder the consequences of systems designed around fear and incarceration rather than prevention and self-determination.

**Our Solution: Community Ownership & Economic Self-Determination**

JusticeHub fundamentally shifts who owns and benefits from justice knowledge. This isn't about creating another platform—it's about building community power through:

1. **True Community Ownership (Not Just "Community-Led")**
   - Platform legally owned by community-governed Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation (ACCO) by Year 5
   - A Curious Tractor's role transitions from owner to service provider
   - Communities control all decisions: what's shared, how it's used, who benefits
   - No external organisation can pull funding and shut it down
   - Permanent infrastructure that outlives individual projects or funders

2. **Breaking Philanthropic Dependency Cycles**
   - Innovative revenue streams reduce reliance on grants by 30-75% within 5 years
   - Communities compensated for sharing their knowledge and programs
   - Revenue from memberships, training, consulting flows to Community Investment Fund
   - Fund redistributes to participating communities—not back to organisations or funders
   - Long-term financial sustainability means communities can say "no" to inappropriate funding
   - Economic self-determination, not perpetual grant-seeking

3. **Knowledge Sovereignty & Fair Compensation**
   - Communities decide what knowledge is shared and how
   - Cultural protocols embedded in platform design by First Nations Advisory Council
   - Clear intellectual property rights—communities own their content
   - Compensation for cultural intelligence and program innovations (not extraction)
   - Ability to remove content anytime
   - No academic or government exploitation of community knowledge

4. **Systems Change Through Visibility & Evidence**
   - Proven programs become accessible to funders, policymakers, practitioners
   - Reduced duplication across sector saves an estimated $5M+ annually
   - Evidence base for what works drives policy change
   - Communities positioned as experts and thought leaders, not service recipients
   - Global influence: Australia leads in Indigenous-led justice innovation

**What This Means for Philanthropy:**

This is not a traditional grant relationship. Mindaroo's investment would be:
- **Seed capital for community ownership**, not ongoing program funding
- **Building permanent infrastructure**, not dependent services
- **Creating financial independence**, not creating new dependencies
- **Time-limited partnership** with clear exit strategy (5 years)
- **Multiplier investment**: Revenue model means Mindaroo's dollars multiply—communities continue to benefit long after philanthropic investment ends

Your 3-year investment creates something that exists forever, owned by communities, generating sustainable revenue, and reducing the sector's philanthropic dependency. This is transformational philanthropy, not transactional funding.

**Strategic Fit with Mindaroo's Prevention Focus:**

While youth justice is our primary focus, this work creates critical prevention infrastructure:
- **Intergenerational trauma prevention:** Supporting young people today prevents trauma for their future children
- **Evidence for early childhood programs:** Longitudinal tracking shows which 0-5 interventions prevent later justice involvement
- **Family-centered approaches:** Communities address root causes across the life course, including 0-5 supports
- **Prevention ROI:** Platform enables cost-benefit analysis to demonstrate early intervention impact

This connection strengthens the case and aligns with Mindaroo's priorities, but youth justice communities need this infrastructure regardless of early childhood linkages. The project stands on its own merit—the 0-5 connection is a strategic bonus, not the foundation.

### Indigenous Data Sovereignty Model

**Foundational Principle:** Communities and individuals control their own knowledge, stories, and data—not researchers, not funders, not external organisations.

JusticeHub treats Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) as infrastructure to be engineered, governed, and enforced. The model combines legal instruments, technical controls, and cultural protocols so that communities decide what is shared, who benefits, and when participation stops.

**Legal Structure & Ownership**
- Platform incorporated within an Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation (ACCO) by Year 5, with enabling legislation drafted in Year 2
- Data trust deed drafted with Indigenous legal services sets rules for access, benefit-sharing, and enforcement
- Memoranda of understanding with each partner community cover IP ownership, dispute resolution, withdrawal processes, and benefit distribution
- Terms of service and licensing language co-designed with First Nations legal advisors; enforceable under Australian law

**Consent & Licensing Architecture**
- Dual consent pathway: community authority sign-off for program knowledge and individual consent for personal stories, imagery, and audio
- Layered consent choices at upload (public, sector-only, First Nations-only, community-only, private archive)
- Revocable consent honoured contractually and technically—content removed within 48 hours of request with audit trail
- Purpose-specific licences (e.g. Creative Commons, community-only) embedded in metadata and surfaced before any download or reuse
- All external researchers required to sign data use agreements with community review and pre-publication approval rights

**Technical Controls & Security**
- Data hosted on Australian ISO 27001-certified infrastructure with geo-fencing; encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control mapped to consent layers and monitored via immutable access logs
- Annual penetration testing, quarterly vulnerability scans, and 24-hour breach notification protocol to affected communities and Mindaroo
- Privacy-by-design approach: minimum data collection, multi-factor authentication, secure archival procedures for withdrawn content
- Zero tolerance for data brokerage—no third-party analytics or adtech integrations

**Governance & Accountability**
- First Nations Advisory Council approves all protocols, licences, and data access decisions and can veto partnerships
- Independent Indigenous ethics review completed annually with findings published to communities and Mindaroo
- Community complaints process with service standards (response within 5 days, resolution within 30 days) and escalation to external mediator if needed
- Revenue from commercial use routed through the Community Investment Fund with transparent reporting each quarter

**Inclusive Application Beyond Indigenous Communities**
- Consent, licensing, and governance pathways extend to CALD, rural, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities working in youth justice
- Cultural safety checks ensure community-specific protocols are respected while remaining anchored in IDS principles
- Advisory Council seats reserved for partner communities beyond First Nations to maintain whole-of-sector representation without diluting Indigenous leadership

**Why This Matters**
- Prevents knowledge extraction by requiring lawful consent, enforceable licences, and community veto rights
- Reduces legal and reputational risk for Mindaroo through gold-standard data governance
- Builds long-term trust, increasing willingness of communities—Indigenous and otherwise—to share proven practice
- Positions JusticeHub as sector benchmark for ethical data stewardship, encouraging broader system change

### The Current Crisis

**Information Fragmentation:**
- Best-practice programs remain hidden in individual communities
- Practitioners reinvent solutions that already exist elsewhere
- Research sits in academic journals, not practitioner hands
- Indigenous knowledge is extracted but never returned or compensated

**Funding Inefficiency:**
- Organisations spend an estimated 30-40% of time writing grants for funding they don't receive
- Successful models can't scale due to lack of visibility
- Funders can't find effective programs to support
- Government programs duplicated across jurisdictions without learning

**Community Exhaustion:**
- Repeated consultations with no action
- Programs imposed without community input
- No pathway from service recipient to service designer
- Cultural intelligence extracted without compensation

### The Opportunity

**Existing Assets:**
- 50+ proven community-led programs ready to share (documented through Justice Reinvestment work)
- Growing network of justice reinvestment communities (Bourke, Moree, Mount Isa, etc.)
- Potential funding partners expressing strong interest (Dusseldorp, Snow Foundation, Paul Ramsay Foundation, Fairfax Foundation)
- Technical infrastructure: program directory supported by Justice Reinvestment initiatives, with platform architecture ready for expansion
- International interest (Indigenous communities globally seeking connection)

**Market Gap:**
- No centralized intelligence hub for youth justice best practices
- No platform for Indigenous-to-Indigenous knowledge sharing
- No sustainable model for community-owned justice innovation
- No bridge between early childhood and youth justice evidence

**Timing:**
- Queensland government has invested $330 million in justice community programs, including Circuit Breaker ($80M)
- National Justice Reinvestment expansion across multiple states
- Growing recognition of Indigenous-led solutions as best practice
- Post-pandemic acceptance of digital knowledge-sharing infrastructure
- Mindaroo's commitment to systems change and early childhood prevention

*Detailed line-item budgets are consolidated in Appendix A; main body now focuses on strategic rationale and outcomes.*

**Budget Revision Note (October 2025):** All levels have been revised upward to reflect:
- **Proper community compensation:** Indigenous knowledge holders and organizations paid at consultant rates, not token stipends ($180K per community annually for 6 communities in Level 2)
- **A Curious Tractor organizational capacity:** Explicit 11-12% project management overhead to ensure sustainable delivery of this complex systems-change initiative ($320-395K annually in Level 2)
- **Business development capacity:** Dedicated role from Year 2 to build revenue streams ($80-100K annually)

These revisions ensure the project is **genuinely sustainable for all partners** and properly values Indigenous knowledge and cultural intelligence.

### Level 1: Minimal Viable Impact ($5.2M - $7.1M over 3 years)

**Philosophy:** "Start with the essentials, prove the model, build community capacity"

This level focuses on core digital infrastructure and pilot community partnerships. It's the Datsun - reliable, gets you where you need to go, builds trust through consistency. Critically, it includes capacity building from Day 1, with costs reducing over time as communities take control.

**Components:**

**Digital Platform (Year 1 Focus)**
- Basic program directory (searchable, filterable, community-submitted)
- Story library (video, text, audio from pilot communities)
- Resource hub (downloadable templates, guides, frameworks)

- Equip 5-10 community members in content creation and platform management
- Establish international learning partnerships (e.g., NZ, Canada) with reciprocal visits
- Collect evaluation evidence on knowledge sharing and practice change across pilot sites
- Transition platform administration from external team to community-led contributors
- Demonstrate 15-20% cost reduction in Year 3 through community capability replacing external contractors

**Sustainability Pathway:**
- **Year 3:** Costs already reducing as community takes control (technical developer reduced to 0.5 FTE)
- **Year 4:** Seek ongoing operational funding at reduced level ($800K-1M, down from $1.5-2.2M)
- **Year 4:** Young Indigenous developers fully leading platform development
- **Year 4+:** Begin exploring premium content model with community-owned revenue
- **Year 5:** Transition to community governance structure (Community Advisory Panel → Governance Board)
- This level proves the capacity-building model works before scaling

**Reality Note on Sustainability Timeline:** Social enterprise revenue takes 5-7 years to mature, not 3-5 years. This revised timeline reflects realistic market development, relationship building, and contract cycles—particularly for government training contracts which take 18-24 months from first conversation to signed agreement. Organizations should budget for bridge funding in Years 4-5 while revenue streams mature.

#### Level 2 Unit Economics (Year 3 Run Rate)

| Metric | Conservative Scenario | Aspirational Scenario |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Annual delivery cost (Year 3) | $4.9M | $3.5M |
| Communities served | 6 | 6 (+2 pipeline communities preparing) |
| Cost per community per year | ~$817K | ~$583K |
| Of which community payment per year | $180K | $180K |
| Programs documented by end of Year 3 | 250 | 320 |
| Cost per documented program | ~$19.6K | ~$10.9K |
| Revenue run-rate (confirmed contracts) | $30K | $60K |
| Net philanthropic requirement (Year 3) | ~$4.87M | ~$3.44M |
| Cost-recovery ratio | 0.6% | 1.7% |
| Indigenous technologists employed | 4 FTE | 5 FTE |
| Community revenue share (to Investment Fund) | $10K | $25K |

*Assumptions:* Scenarios use the revised Level 2 budget range with proper community compensation ($180K per community annually) and A Curious Tractor organizational capacity (11-12% overhead). Conservative scenario includes confirmed contracts only (no speculative grants). Pipeline communities in the aspirational scenario are mentored without additional delivery cost until Year 4.

**Key Cost Drivers:**
- Community payments: $1.08M (22% of budget) - ensuring proper Indigenous knowledge compensation
- Staff costs: $1.68M (34% of budget) - 12 FTE reducing to 9 by Year 3
- A Curious Tractor organizational capacity: $395K (8% of budget) - project management infrastructure
- Platform & technology: $160K (3% of budget)
- Training, events, evaluation: $1.09M (22% of budget)

### Transition Gates & Minimum Readiness Criteria

Mindaroo retains decision points at the end of each phase. Progressing requires evidence against mutually agreed readiness criteria to ensure resourcing follows demonstrated traction and community leadership.

| Gate | Timing | Minimum Readiness Criteria | Mindaroo Decision |
|------|--------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Gate 0: Launch Approval** | Pre-contract | Signed community MOUs (min. 3), IDS legal architecture endorsed by First Nations Advisory Council, independent financial due diligence satisfied | Release Year 1 funds and establish governance cadence |
| **Gate 1: MVP Validation** | End of Year 1 | Platform MVP live with ≥3 communities publishing content, consent & licensing system operating without breach, 80% of planned governance forums delivered, baseline evaluation plan agreed, draft revenue experiments scoped | Confirm Year 2 funding envelope and any scope adjustments |
| **Gate 2: Community Ownership Readiness** | Mid-Year 2 review | Community Governance Board constituted, at least 2 Indigenous developers in paid roles, trainee retention ≥75%, first revenue contracts executed ($25K+), evaluation data set collected and shared with Mindaroo, cybersecurity audit passed | Release remaining Year 2 funds and green-light Year 3 plan |
| **Gate 3: Transition Commitment** | End of Year 2 | Evidence of cost reduction ≥15%, Community Investment Fund rules adopted, updated IDS compliance audit with no critical findings, Mindaroo satisfied with outcomes-to-date report | Approve Year 3 delivery with agreed sustainability targets |

---

### Recommended Approach: Phased Decision Making

**Phase 1: Year 1 - Commit to Level 2 Foundation ($2.8M - $3.6M)**
- Test the model with 6 communities (each receiving $90K for 0.5 year, $180K in Years 2-3)
- Develop platform and core infrastructure
- Establish proper community payment structures from Day 1
- Begin training 4-5 young Indigenous developers/producers
- Establish First Nations Advisory Council with decision-making power
- Generate early evidence of impact and community capacity building
- International learning exchange to NZ

**Phase 2: Year 2 Decision Point - Scale Based on Evidence**

- Demonstrates sustainability before philanthropic investment ends

---

## Part 9: The Ask

### What We're Requesting from Mindaroo

**Primary Request: 3-Year Commitment to Level 2 - Foundational Excellence ($9.5M - $13.0M)**

This is a time-limited partnership to build permanent community-owned infrastructure with proper community compensation and organizational sustainability:

**Year 1:** $2.8M - $3.6M
- Foundation: 6 communities with proper compensation ($540K total, $90K each for 0.5 year)
- Platform development with Indigenous data sovereignty infrastructure
- 12 FTE team building + 4-5 young Indigenous trainees
- A Curious Tractor organizational capacity ($320K)
- Establish First Nations Advisory Council with decision-making power
- International learning exchange (NZ)
- Early evidence generation

**Year 2:** $3.2M - $4.5M (subject to Year 1 progress review)
- Growth: Deep engagement with 6 communities ($1.08M total, $180K each annually)
- Trainees advancing, 15-20 community members training
- Business development role added ($80-100K) to build revenue streams
- National Forum + regional workshops
- International exchange (Canada)
- A Curious Tractor organizational capacity ($390K)
- Cost efficiencies beginning to show

**Year 3:** $3.5M - $4.9M (subject to evidence of impact and sustainability)
- Scale: Cost reduction already evident (20% staff savings through community capacity)
- Community payments continue ($1.08M) - ensuring sustained Indigenous knowledge valuation
- Young Indigenous developers now leading technical work
- Revenue generation: $30-60K (realistic, with clear Year 4-5 growth pipeline)
- Community Governance Board operational and taking control
- Transition planning to community ownership
- A Curious Tractor organizational capacity ($395K)
- **Note:** Even as scope increases, some costs reducing through community capacity

**Total 3-Year Investment: $9.5M - $13.0M**

**What Makes This Different:**
- **Not ongoing program funding** - seed capital for permanent infrastructure
- **Costs reducing over time** - community capacity replaces external contractors
- **Revenue generation built in** - pathway to financial independence
- **Community ownership transition** - not creating dependency on A Curious Tractor
- **Time-limited** - Clear exit strategy by Year 5 when platform is community-owned

**What Makes This Budget Different (October 2025 Revision):**
- **Proper Indigenous knowledge compensation:** $1.08M annually (22% of budget) paid directly to 6 communities at $180K each - consultant rates, not token stipends
- **A Curious Tractor organizational sustainability:** $320-395K annually (11-12% overhead) - ensuring non-extractive project management for complex systems change
- **Business development capacity:** $80-100K from Year 2 - dedicated role to build revenue streams and reduce future philanthropic dependency
- **Realistic revenue timeline:** Revised from 3-5 years to 5-7 years based on actual social enterprise maturation cycles
- **Transparent cost breakdown:** Every dollar accounted for and justified

**With commitment to:**
- **Trust-based reporting** focused on outcomes, learning, and community feedback
- **Flexibility to adapt** based on community leadership and changing needs
- **Recognition that impact takes time** - building community capacity is a 5-7 year journey to financial sustainability
- **Understanding this is about power** - building community ownership and economic self-determination
- **Support through challenges** - honest learning, adaptation, not perfection
- **Phased decision-making** - Year 2 funding contingent on Year 1 evidence
- **Consideration of Years 4-5 bridge funding** at $2.8-3.5M as revenue streams mature (15-25% self-sustaining by Year 4, 35-50% by Year 5)
- **Long-term vision:** By Years 6-7, 50-70% self-sustaining; by Year 8+, 75-85% self-sustaining

## Conclusion: An Invitation to Partnership

This is not just a funding request. It's an invitation to partner in building something that could fundamentally change how we approach youth justice, early childhood prevention, and community-led transformation across the entire sector.

**This is about:**
- Building sector-wide infrastructure that serves **all young people** with Indigenous leadership setting the gold standard
- Trusting communities—Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, LGBTQIA+—to know what they need
- Investing in prevention, not just crisis response
- Building sustainable infrastructure, not dependent programs
- Connecting 0-5 interventions to lifelong outcomes
- Demonstrating that Indigenous data sovereignty frameworks protect everyone
- Creating global models that others can learn from
- Proving that alternative funding approaches and community ownership work

**The opportunity is now:**
- Communities are ready and asking for this
- Sector is eager for better coordination and knowledge sharing
- Technology makes knowledge sharing accessible
- International interest in Indigenous-led approaches is high
- Mindaroo has the vision and resources to make this happen

**The risk of not doing this:**
- Continued fragmentation and reinvention across the entire sector
- Community knowledge—Indigenous, CALD, remote—continues to be extracted, not valued
- **All young people** continue to suffer from systems that don't work
- 0-5 investments can't prove long-term prevention impact
- Australia misses opportunity to lead globally in community-owned, sector-wide transformation

We believe this is the right work, at the right time, with the right partners. We hope Mindaroo agrees.
