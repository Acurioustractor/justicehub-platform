# JusticeHub: Community-Owned Knowledge Platform for Youth Justice
## One-Page Strategic Overview for Mindaroo Foundation

---

### THE PROBLEM: Communities Trapped in Dependency Cycles

**Every young person** in Australia's youth justice system deserves better. The crisis is most acute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people—**17 times more likely** to be in detention—but the knowledge to change this exists across all communities: Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities. Yet this frontline intelligence rarely moves beyond the places where it was born. Fragmented systems and short-term funding mean we keep duplicating effort while innovations remain invisible across the sector.

---

### OUR SOLUTION: Economic Self-Determination Through Community Ownership

JusticeHub creates **community-owned** digital infrastructure serving **all young people** in the youth justice system. This **breaks philanthropic dependency** through revenue generation and capacity building. This is **seed capital for permanent sector infrastructure**, not ongoing programme funding.

**Why Indigenous Leadership?**

The platform is deliberately architected under **Indigenous leadership** for three reasons:

1. **Statistical urgency** — Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are 17x overrepresented in detention, making this the sector's most acute crisis
2. **Knowledge sovereignty** — Indigenous communities have pioneered data sovereignty frameworks that set the gold standard for consent and community control
3. **Sector best practice** — If we build infrastructure that protects Indigenous knowledge properly, we protect everyone

**The platform serves all communities** working in youth justice—Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, LGBTQIA+—with Indigenous governance ensuring the highest standards of consent, cultural safety, and community control for everyone.

**What Makes This Different:**
- ✅ **Serves all young people** with Indigenous governance setting the gold standard
- ✅ **Costs reduce over time** (20-26% by Year 3) through community capacity building
- ✅ **Young Indigenous people** trained and employed as developers/producers
- ✅ **Revenue generation** built in ($50-500K by Year 3 depending on level)
- ✅ **Legal ownership** transfers to community-governed ACCO by Year 5
- ✅ **Indigenous data sovereignty protects everyone** via layered consent, Australian hosting, and legal trust deed
- ✅ **Fair compensation for all communities** — Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, LGBTQIA+ ($180K per community annually)
- ✅ **Time-limited partnership** (3-5 years), not perpetual dependency

### HOW IT WORKS: The Capacity Building Model

**Year 1:** External staff + Indigenous trainees → Platform development + training (starting with 6 Indigenous communities)
**Year 2:** Trainees advancing, community members training → Costs starting to reduce, CALD/remote/disability/LGBTQIA+ communities joining
**Year 3:** Indigenous developers **leading** technical work → **20-26% cost savings**, revenue generating, all community types engaged

### THREE IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS

| Level | Investment | Communities | Key Features | Cost Reduction | Sustainability |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **1: Minimal** | **$5.2-7.1M** | 3-5 | Basic platform, 2-3 trainees, international learning | 15-20% by Year 3 | Foundation proven |
| **2: Foundational** ⭐ | **$9.5-13.0M** | 6 | Deep engagement, 4-5 trainees, National Forums, international best-practice | 20% by Year 3 | 60-70% by Year 5 |
| **3: Comprehensive** | **$17.5-22.5M** | 10 | Infrastructure grants, 6-8 trainees, Global Forum, media/arts campaign | 26% by Year 3 | 75-85% by Year 5 |

### RECOMMENDED: LEVEL 2 - FOUNDATIONAL EXCELLENCE | $9.5M - $13.0M

**The Investment:**
- **Year 1:** $2.8M - $3.6M → Foundation: 6 communities, platform, team, training begins
- **Year 2:** $3.2M - $4.5M → Growth: Cost efficiencies beginning, National Forum, international exchange *(subject to Year 1 evidence)*
- **Year 3:** $3.5M - $4.9M → Scale: 20% cost reduction evident, revenue $50-100K, Governance Board operational *(subject to progress)*

> **Budget Note (October 2025):** This budget reflects proper compensation for Indigenous knowledge at consultant rates ($180K per community annually, not token stipends) and explicit A Curious Tractor organizational capacity (~11-12% overhead) to ensure sustainable delivery of this complex systems-change initiative.

**What $9.5M - $13.0M Achieves (3 Years):**
- **300+ programmes** documented with community-owned implementation guides
- **4-5 young Indigenous developers/producers** trained and employed (formerly trainees)
- **15-20 community members** trained in content creation, platform management, data collection
- **20% staff cost reduction** ($256K annual savings) through community capacity
- **2 National Forums** + 8 regional workshops delivered
- **International connections** (NZ, Canada) positioning Australia as regional leader
- **Revenue generation:** $50-100K by Year 3, growing to $400-600K by Year 5
- **Community Governance Board** operational and transitioning to full ownership
- **60-70% financially self-sustaining by Year 5**

**Centre of Excellence & State Hubs**

- Establish a national **Youth Justice Centre of Excellence** that curates the best community-led practice, evidence, and training
- Create **state-based hubs** anchored in local community organisations to host workshops, co-design sprints, and practitioner exchanges
- Aggregate data, case studies, and impact evidence so local programs can scale without losing cultural integrity
- Provide innovation sandboxes that help communities test restorative, culturally informed solutions rather than relying on fear-driven, punitive responses
- Position Australia as a world leader in community-focused youth justice, exporting insight and welcoming global best practice back into local contexts

### STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT WITH MINDAROO

**Youth Justice AND Early Childhood Prevention:**
- **Intergenerational trauma prevention:** Supporting youth today prevents trauma for tomorrow's 0-5 year olds
- **Longitudinal evidence:** Track which 0-5 programmes prevent later justice involvement
- **Prevention ROI:** Platform enables cost-benefit analysis for early intervention

**But also:** Youth justice communities need this infrastructure regardless of 0-5 linkages. The project stands on its own merit—the early childhood connection is a **strategic bonus**, not the foundation.

### IMPACT: WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**For All Young People:**
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people get culturally safe, healing-centered approaches proven in community
- CALD young people get services that respect their cultural backgrounds and family structures
- Young people with disabilities get trauma-informed care tailored to their needs
- LGBTQIA+ young people get affirming support from practitioners who understand their experiences
- ALL young people benefit from evidence-based practice, not punishment-based systems
- **Pathways:** Young people from all backgrounds become platform contributors, developers, storytellers, and leaders—not just service recipients

**For Communities:** Legal ownership, young people employed, revenue generated, no more grant dependency—Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities all compensated fairly
**For the Sector:** Access to proven programmes, $5M+ annual savings from reduced duplication, better outcomes across all community types
**For Mindaroo:** Leadership in transformational philanthropy, community ownership model proven, impact multiplying beyond investment—demonstrating how Indigenous-led governance creates best practice for everyone

### SUSTAINABILITY: BREAKING PHILANTHROPIC DEPENDENCY

**Revenue Streams:** Organisational memberships, government training contracts, premium content/consulting
**Financial Trajectory (Level 2):**
- Year 3: $50-100K revenue, 20% cost reduction
- Year 4: $200-300K revenue, philanthropic need reduced to $2.5-3.5M (from $3.5-4.9M)
- Year 5: $400-600K revenue, philanthropic need $1.5-2.0M, **60-70% self-sustaining**
- Year 6+: Community-owned ACCO operational, 75-85% self-sustaining, minimal philanthropic dependency

---

### RISK MITIGATION

**Community Consultation Fatigue** → Pay properly, early wins, decision-making power to communities  
**Technology Adoption** → Mobile-first, offline capability, in-person support  
**Funding Sustainability** → Diversified revenue from Year 1, conservative projections, capacity building  
**Cultural Appropriation** → First Nations Advisory Council controls all protocols, communities own content  
**Cybersecurity & Privacy** → ISO-aligned hosting, MFA, annual penetration tests, 24-hour breach response  
**Safeguarding & Duty of Care** → Trauma-informed practice, clinical supervision, clear escalation for disclosures, moderation guidelines

---

### THE ASK: $9.5M - $13.0M OVER 3 YEARS (LEVEL 2)

**What We Need:**
- Trust-based reporting (outcomes, not inputs)
- Flexibility to adapt based on community feedback
- Phased commitment with evidence gates (Year 2 contingent on Year 1 results)
- Recognition that building capacity takes 3-5 years
- Consideration of Years 4-5 support at reduced level ($2.5-3.5M)

**What Makes This Transformational:**
This is not ongoing programme funding. Your 3-year investment creates **permanent infrastructure** that:
- Exists **forever**, owned by communities
- Generates **sustainable revenue**
- **Reduces costs** over time through capacity building
- Continues **benefiting communities** long after philanthropic investment ends

---

### NEXT STEPS
