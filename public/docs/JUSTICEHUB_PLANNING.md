# JusticeHub Planning Framework
## Comprehensive Costing, Prioritization & Community-Led Development

**Date:** January 2025
**Purpose:** Operational planning tool for building JusticeHub elements at the right scale
**Philosophy:** Community-led responses and support embedded in every element

---

## 🎯 Planning Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Community-Led at Every Level**
- Young people and communities define priorities
- Those with lived experience shape content and direction
- Local leaders drive local engagement
- Bottom-up, not top-down approach
- Cultural safety and responsiveness central

**Start Small, Scale Smart**
- Test and learn before investing heavily
- Pilot in 1-2 communities before national rollout
- Build incrementally based on community need
- Evidence of impact drives investment decisions

**Build for Sustainability**
- Design for long-term viability from day one
- Diversified funding model (not reliant on single source)
- Community ownership ensures continuation
- Revenue-generating where appropriate

**Measure What Matters**
- Track community engagement and satisfaction
- Measure practice change, not just platform metrics
- Young people's outcomes as ultimate measure
- Continuous feedback and adaptation

## 🎯 Prioritization Framework

### How to Decide What to Fund?

**Three Key Questions:**
1. **Community Need:** Is this what communities are asking for?
2. **Feasibility:** Can we do this well with available resources?
3. **Impact Potential:** Will this create meaningful change?

### Priority Matrix

```
HIGH IMPACT + HIGH FEASIBILITY = DO FIRST ⭐
HIGH IMPACT + LOW FEASIBILITY = PLAN & BUILD TOWARD 📅
LOW IMPACT + HIGH FEASIBILITY = QUICK WINS (if spare capacity) ⚡
LOW IMPACT + LOW FEASIBILITY = DON'T DO ❌
```
