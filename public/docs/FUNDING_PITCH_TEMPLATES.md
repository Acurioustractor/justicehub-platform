## üìù Template 2: Foundation/Philanthropy Pitch

### Subject: Transforming Youth Justice Through Community-Led Knowledge Sharing

**To:** [Foundation Name]
**From:** JusticeHub Initiative
**Grant Type:** [Program area]
**Amount Requested:** $[amount]
**Duration:** [timeframe]

---

**THE OPPORTUNITY**

Across Australia, thousands of young people enter the youth justice system each year. Most are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Most have experienced trauma. Most are from disadvantaged communities. And most will return to the system unless we fundamentally change how we respond to them.

JusticeHub offers a pathway to transformation: **community-led knowledge sharing that shifts practice, builds movements, and creates better futures for young people.**

We seek $[amount] to [specific initiative], directly supporting your foundation's commitment to [foundation priority].

**WHY THIS MATTERS**

**The Human Cost:**
- [X] young people in youth justice system annually
- [X]% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (gross over-representation)
- [X]% have experienced trauma, abuse, or neglect
- [X]% recidivism rates - system fails to rehabilitate
- Lifelong impacts: education disruption, unemployment, ongoing justice involvement

**The System Failure:**
- Over-reliance on detention (Australia's rate [X] times international average)
- Under-investment in diversion and alternatives
- Workforce ill-equipped: limited training, high burnout
- Disconnect between research evidence and practice reality
- Fragmentation: no systematic knowledge sharing
- Aboriginal communities excluded from leadership and design

**The Possibility:**
- Evidence shows diversion and therapeutic approaches work
- Community-led programs achieve remarkable outcomes
- Young people can heal and thrive with right support
- Systems can change when knowledge and will combine
- **JusticeHub makes this possible at scale**

**OUR APPROACH: COMMUNITY-LED TRANSFORMATION**

JusticeHub is different. We don't tell communities what to do. We support communities to lead change, share what works, and build movements.

**1. Stories That Shift Narratives**
- Young people tell their stories, their way
- Lived experience expertise valued equally with professional
- Humanize young people; shift from punishment to care
- Stories drive empathy, understanding, practice change

**2. Knowledge Accessible to Those Who Need It**
- Evidence translated from academic jargon to practice reality
- Program profiles from communities doing great work
- Toolkits for implementation, not just theory
- Aboriginal programs prominently featured
- Free, accessible, community-owned

**3. Local Leaders Driving Change**
- Community members (not external consultants) lead locally
- Trusted by young people, families, services
- Build networks, facilitate learning, advocate for change
- Support [X] communities with place-based leaders

**4. Movements for Systemic Change**
- Connect isolated practitioners into communities of practice
- Young people's forums for voice and advocacy
- Cultural gatherings for Aboriginal-led change
- National momentum from local actions

**WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT**

| Traditional Approach | JusticeHub Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Expert-driven, top-down | Community-led, bottom-up |
| Academic knowledge privileged | Multiple ways of knowing valued |
| Programs for communities | Communities lead programs |
| Deficit focus (problems) | Strength focus (solutions) |
| Short-term projects | Long-term movement building |
| Evaluation by outsiders | Community defines success |
