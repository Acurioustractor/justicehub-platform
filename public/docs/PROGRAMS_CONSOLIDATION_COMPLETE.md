# Global Programs Consolidation - Complete!

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ✅ Fully Consolidated into Single Page

## What Was Done

### Problem Solved
You had **two separate pages** for international programs:
- `/centre-of-excellence/global-insights` - Detailed view with expandable cards
- `/centre-of-excellence/programs` - Grid view with search/filters

Both pages showed similar data but had different features.

### Solution
**Consolidated everything into `/centre-of-excellence/global-insights`** as the single unified page with:
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Region filtering
- ✅ Evidence strength filtering
- ✅ Expandable program details
- ✅ Interactive map
- ✅ Top statistics
- ✅ All 16 programs from database

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced global-insights Page
**Added from programs page:**
- Search bar (by name, country, description)
- Region dropdown filter (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, etc.)
- Evidence strength filter (Rigorous RCT, Longitudinal Study, etc.)
- Filter count display ("Showing X of Y programs")
- "Clear all filters" button

**Kept from original:**
- Top stats cards (recidivism rates, key metrics)
- Interactive map with locations
- Expandable program cards with full details
- Evidence badges and outcome displays
- Australian adaptation sections

### 2. Redirected programs Page
The `/centre-of-excellence/programs` page now **automatically redirects** to `/centre-of-excellence/global-insights`

**File updated:**
- [src/app/centre-of-excellence/programs/page.tsx](/src/app/centre-of-excellence/programs/page.tsx)

```typescript
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export default function ProgramsPage() {
  redirect('/centre-of-excellence/global-insights');
}
```

### 3. Verified Database Integrity
Ran duplicate check:
- ✅ No duplicate programs found
- ✅ 16 unique programs in database
- ✅ All slugs unique
