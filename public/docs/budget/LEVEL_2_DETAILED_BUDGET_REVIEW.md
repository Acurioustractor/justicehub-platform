## QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION:

### Budget Realignment Needed:
1. **Staff costs too high?** 13 FTE at $1.9M is ~60% of conservative budget. Should we reduce FTE count or salaries?
2. **Community payments non-negotiable?** $1.08M is 30% of budget - correct priority?
3. **Platform costs realistic?** $283K-$409K for Year 2 enhancements - too ambitious?
4. **Events & Forums necessary?** $260K-$380K - could some be virtual to reduce costs?
5. **ACT overhead too high?** $320K-$415K - could this be lower?

### Specific Line Items to Critique:
1. **Are Indigenous trainees paid enough?** $15K for 6 months, $20K full year = $1,667/month
2. **Are knowledge holder payments sufficient?** $3,300-$5,000 per person annually
3. **Is $5K per Advisory Council meeting enough?** Should it be $7-10K including travel/prep?
4. **Do we need 13 FTE in Year 2?** Could we manage with 11-12 FTE?
5. **Is Business Development Manager critical from Year 2?** Or can this wait until Year 3?

## YEAR 3 BUDGET: $3.5M - $4.9M

**I'll create Year 3 detail if you want, but let's critique Year 1 and 2 first before building Year 3.**

## NEXT STEPS:

1. Review each line item above
2. Identify what's too high, too low, or missing
3. Decide on priorities (what's essential vs. nice-to-have)
4. Realign Year 2 to fit $3.2M-$4.5M range
5. Build Year 3 budget once Year 1-2 are solid

**What should we tackle first?**
