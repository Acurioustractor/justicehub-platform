- Developed clear strategic direction worth ~$33K

**This demonstrates:**
✅ Technical capability - platform exists and works

## SIMPLIFIED COMMUNITY PAYMENT STRUCTURE

**Problem with previous model:** Too many line items, confusing, hard to understand value

**NEW MODEL: Annual Partnership Packages**

### Community Partnership = Three Components

#### **1. ANNUAL PARTNERSHIP FEE (covers ongoing engagement)**
One simple annual payment for sustained engagement throughout the year:

| Scenario | Annual Partnership Fee | What It Covers |
|----------|------------------------|----------------|
| **LEAN** | **$60K per community/year** | Retainer for local coordinator (part-time), basic engagement, 12 monthly check-ins, basic content support |
| **BASE** | **$80K per community/year** | Retainer for local coordinator (2 days/week), solid engagement, monthly sessions, good content support, equipment |
| **UPPER** | **$100K per community/year** | Retainer for local coordinator (3 days/week), deep engagement, bi-weekly sessions, comprehensive support, premium equipment |

**What the Annual Partnership Fee covers:**
- Local community coordinator retainer (paid monthly)
- Regular monthly engagement and check-ins
- Basic equipment and technology needs
- Cultural protocol costs
- Administrative support
- Meeting attendance (standard meetings)
- Baseline content creation support

#### **2. KNOWLEDGE HOLDER PAYMENTS (pay per session)**
**Separate, transparent per-session payments for Elders, cultural practitioners, program experts:**

| Scenario | Rate per Session | Typical Sessions/Year | Annual Total |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **LEAN** | $750/session | 12 sessions | $9K |
| **BASE** | $1,000/session | 16 sessions | $16K |
| **UPPER** | $1,200/session | 20 sessions | $24K |

**What's a session?**
- 4-5 hour knowledge sharing session with Elders/experts
- $1,000 = $200/hour × 5 hours (BASE rate)
- Includes preparation time, cultural load, expertise
- Payments go directly to individual knowledge holders

#### **3. CONTENT CREATION BOUNTIES (pay per piece)**
**Clear payments for specific content pieces created:**

| Content Type | LEAN | BASE | UPPER | Notes |
|--------------|------|------|-------|-------|
| Video story (community-produced) | $2,000 | $2,500 | $3,000 | Per completed video with editing |
| Written story | $500 | $600 | $750 | Per published story with interviews |
| Program documentation | $800 | $1,000 | $1,200 | Per program fully documented |
| Podcast interview | $400 | $500 | $600 | Per recorded interview |

**Benefits of this model:**
- ✅ Clear value for specific deliverables
- ✅ Communities control how much they engage
- ✅ More content = more payment (incentive aligned)
- ✅ Easy to understand and explain

## TOTAL COMMUNITY PAYMENT EXAMPLES (Full Year)

### Example: BASE Scenario Community Engagement

**6 Communities, Full Year:**

| Payment Type | Per Community | 6 Communities |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Annual Partnership Fee | $80K | $480K |
| Knowledge Holder Sessions (16 × $1K) | $16K | $96K |
| Content Creation (4 videos, 6 stories, 3 programs) | $20K | $120K |
| **Total Community Payments** | **$116K** | **$696K** |

**Contingency buffer (15%)** | $17.4K | $104K |
**TOTAL WITH BUFFER** | **$133.4K** | **$800K** |

**For Year 1 (6 months):** $400K

## QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

### **Community Payments:**
1. **Annual Partnership Fee:** Is $40-50K per community fair for year-long coordinator retainer + base engagement?
2. **Knowledge Holder Sessions:** Is $1,000 per session (5 hours × $200/hour) appropriate?
3. **Content Bounties:** Are $2,500 per video, $600 per story, $1,000 per program doc fair?

### **Indigenous Trainees:**
1. Is $3,000/month (BASE) livable for trainees in Year 1?
2. Should it be higher - $3,500-4,000/month?
3. Is 4 trainees the right number for BASE?

### **Staff:**
1. Are 5 FTE adequate for BASE scenario with 6 communities?
2. Should Community Engagement be 1.5 FTE (not 1.0) for 6 communities?
3. Is 0.75 FTE Platform/Tech Lead enough in Year 1?

### **Platform:**
1. Is $180K realistic for quality platform build in 6 months?
2. Should we allocate more ($220-250K) for BASE?
3. What features are truly essential vs. nice-to-have?

### **Budget Allocation:**
1. Is 30% to Community Engagement the right priority?
2. Should we increase Indigenous Capacity Building (currently 7%)?
3. Is 8% for ACT Organizational fair and transparent?

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Recommend BASE Scenario ($1.7M Year 1) with adjustments:**

### Potential Adjustments to BASE:
1. **Increase Community Engagement Lead to 1.25 FTE** → +$16K
2. **Increase trainee stipends to $20K** (from $18K) → +$8K
3. **Increase platform budget to $320K** (from $296K) → +$24K
4. **Adjusted BASE Year 1:** $1.7M → **$1.75M**

This provides:
- ✅ Proper community compensation
- ✅ Livable trainee stipends
- ✅ Quality platform build
- ✅ Adequate staff capacity
- ✅ Sustainable ACT organizational fee

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Review and adjust specific line items in BASE scenario**
2. **Finalize community payment structure**
3. **Build Year 2 and Year 3 using same framework**
4. **Create summary tables for Mindaroo pitch**

**What line items should we adjust first?**
