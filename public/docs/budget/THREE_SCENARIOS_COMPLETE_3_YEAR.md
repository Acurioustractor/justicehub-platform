# JusticeHub: Three Investment Scenarios - Complete 3-Year Comparison
## LEAN, BASE, and UPPER Options with Full Year 1

---

## PRE-BUDGET: VALUE ALREADY CREATED (2024-2025)

**Before any Mindaroo investment, JusticeHub has already delivered $303K in value:**

| Category | Work Completed | Value |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Platform Development** | Working Next.js MVP, Supabase backend, core features built | $183K |
| **Content & Research** | 15+ programs documented, 8-10 stories, excellence map research | $57K |
| **Community Relationships** | Initial engagement with Oonchiumpa, Bourke, others | $30K |
| **Strategic Planning** | Pitch development, budget modeling, partnership frameworks | $33K |
| **TOTAL VALUE CREATED** | | **$303K** |

**Why this matters:** Mindaroo invests in proven concept with momentum, not untested idea.

### Three Simple Components:

**1. Annual Partnership Fee** → One payment covers base engagement
**2. Knowledge Holder Sessions** → Pay-per-session for Elders/experts
