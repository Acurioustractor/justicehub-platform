### Cost Reduction Through Capacity Building

|---------------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Platform/Tech Lead | $56K (0.75 FTE) | $75K (0.5 FTE) | **$0** (eliminated) | **-$75K** |
| Platform Development | $296K (build) | $210K (enhance) | $170K (maintain) | **-$126K** |
| Indigenous Trainees | $125K (stipends) | $150K (stipends) | $220K (PAID staff) | +$70K but **they replaced Tech Lead** |
| **NET SAVINGS** | | | | **~$130K** |

**KEY INSIGHT:** By Year 3, we're spending LESS on platform/tech while delivering MORE, because Indigenous developers are leading the work.

## RISK MITIGATION

### How This Budget Reduces Risk

1. **Pre-Budget Value ($303K):** Platform already works, relationships exist → Technical risk reduced
2. **Phased Staffing:** Start 5 FTE → reduce as capacity grows → Financial risk managed
3. **Indigenous Capacity:** 4 trainees replace expensive external roles → Sustainability risk reduced
4. **Pay-per-Engagement:** Communities paid for actual work → Value-for-money risk reduced
5. **Revenue from Year 3:** Early revenue testing → Long-term sustainability risk reduced
6. **ACT Organizational (8%):** Fair fee for complex project management → Delivery risk reduced

- **Review:** Mid-term evaluation, community capacity, trainee advancement, revenue potential
- **Decision:** Proceed to Year 3 transition or extend Year 2 approach?

**Gate 3: End of Year 3 (30 months)**
- **Review:** Summative evaluation, community readiness, revenue trajectory, sustainability plan
- **Decision:** Bridge funding Years 4-5? Scale to more communities? Exit strategy?
