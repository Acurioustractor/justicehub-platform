# JusticeHub Site Overview
## Understanding What's Here and Why

**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## What is JusticeHub?

JusticeHub is a digital platform serving **all young people** in Australia's youth justice system. The platform is built under **Indigenous leadership** because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are 17 times more likely to be in detention—making this the sector's most urgent crisis.

**Simple version:** We're building a website where communities can share what works in youth justice, get paid fairly for their knowledge, and eventually own the whole platform themselves.

**Why this matters:** Right now, good programs stay hidden in the communities where they started. JusticeHub makes them visible to everyone who needs them—Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities all benefit.

## The Big Picture: Why Does This All Exist?

**The Problem:**
- Good programs exist but stay hidden
- Communities don't get paid for their knowledge
- Everyone keeps reinventing the wheel

- Knowledge gets shared across the sector
- Indigenous leadership sets the gold standard for everyone

**The Goal:**
- Communities own the platform by Year 5
- Platform generates its own revenue (60-70% self-sustaining)
- No more philanthropic dependency
- Young people from all backgrounds get evidence-based support, not punishment
