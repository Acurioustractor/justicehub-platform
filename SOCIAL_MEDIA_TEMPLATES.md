### Thread Option 1: The Numbers

**Tweet 1:**
25 young people.
20 years.
$0 in funding.

While services with millions compete over "tick-and-flick funding," Aunty Corrine has been doing the actual work—unpaid, 24/7, in Mount Isa.

This is what community-led actually looks like. 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
"I've had 25 MBBs go through my house. Most have gone back to their families. Most are doing pretty good."

MBBs = "Misunderstood Black Boys."

That's what Aunty calls them. Because she sees what systems don't.

**Tweet 3:**
A boy sat silently in Cleveland Detention for 4 days.

Staff couldn't get him to talk.

Aunty Corrine walked in: "What's your name, darling?"

"I'm not allowed to say my name to white people."

30 minutes later, he was talking. 2 days later, he was out.

**Tweet 4:**
Steven was in Cleveland at 14.

Services said he'd never make it.

Now he's independent, connected to family, thriving.

Not because of a program. Because an Aunty answered the phone at 2am and didn't give up.

**Tweet 5:**
"I need voices behind me. Not just funding. Voices."

### Thread Option 2: The Quote

**Tweet 1:**
"Tick-and-flick funding keep rolling in for what? Because we still got a lot of bad children on the streets."

— Aunty Corrine, who has supported 25 young people through the justice system in Mount Isa. Unpaid. For 20 years.

New story from @JusticeHubAU 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
While services compete for millions:

Aunty Corrine answers calls at 2am
Sits in Cleveland Detention for hours
Provides housing when families struggle
Keeps young people connected to culture

All unpaid. All unrecognized. All essential.

**Tweet 3:**
Of the 25 young people she's supported:

✓ Most are now independent and stable
✓ Strong family connections maintained
✓ Diverted from long-term detention
✓ Supported through systems that don't talk

This is expertise. This is evidence.

**Tweet 4:**
"I need voices behind me."

Not another service extracting data.
Not another tick-and-flick program.

Voices. Decision-making power. Infrastructure Aunties control.

### Option 1: Professional/Policy Focus

**Headline:** The Economics of Unpaid Expertise: 20 Years, 25 Young People, $0 Funding

**Body:**
In Mount Isa, Queensland, Aunty Corrine has supported 25 young people through the youth justice system over two decades. The cost? Her own time, resources, and wellbeing—unpaid, 24/7, for 20 years.

**The Evidence:**
- Most young people now independent and stable
- Strong family and community connections maintained
- Youth diverted from long-term detention
- Crisis intervention available around the clock

**The Reality:**
While government services with multi-million dollar budgets compete over "tick-and-flick funding," Aunty Corrine is the one:
- Answering calls at 2am when young people are in crisis
- Sitting in Cleveland Youth Detention Centre for hours
- Navigating systems that don't communicate with each other
- Providing stable housing when families are struggling

**The Question:**
How do we move from extracting community expertise to actually compensating it?

Not with another service. Not with more data collection.

With voices. Decision-making power. Infrastructure that communities control.

### Option 2: Storytelling Focus

**Headline:** "I Need Voices Behind Me": What Community-Led Actually Looks Like

**Body:**
A 14-year-old boy sat in Cleveland Youth Detention Centre for 4 days without speaking.

Trained staff tried everything. Psychologists, counselors, youth workers—nothing worked.

Then Aunty Corrine walked in.

"What's your name, darling?"

The boy looked up: "I'm not allowed to say my name to white people."

Within 30 minutes, he was talking. Within 2 days, he was out.

**This is the expertise that no qualification can teach.**

For 20 years in Mount Isa, Aunty Corrine has supported 25 young people through the justice system—unpaid, using knowledge that comes from lived experience, cultural connection, and showing up when everyone else has given up.

Her story raises critical questions for anyone working in justice, social services, or policy:

→ Why is community expertise unpaid while services with millions in funding deliver "tick-and-flick" approaches?
→ How do we move from consultation to actual decision-making power?
→ What would justice look like if Elders had voices, not just seats at tables?

"I need voices behind me," Aunty Corrine says. "Not just funding. Voices."

**"I Need Voices Behind Me": Aunty Corrine's 20 Years of Unpaid Justice Work**

In Mount Isa, Queensland, while government services with millions in funding compete over "tick-and-flick" approaches, Aunty Corrine has been doing the actual work—unpaid, 24/7, for 20 years.

She's supported 25 young people through the justice system. She calls them "MBBs"—Misunderstood Black Boys—because she sees what systems don't.

**One Story:**

A 14-year-old boy sat in Cleveland Youth Detention Centre for 4 days without speaking. Trained staff, psychologists, counselors—no one could help.

Then Aunty Corrine walked in.

"What's your name, darling?"

The boy looked up: "I'm not allowed to say my name to white people."

Within 30 minutes, he was talking. Within 2 days, he was out.

This is the expertise that no qualification can teach.

**The Evidence:**

Of the 25 young people Aunty Corrine has supported:
✓ Most are now independent, in stable housing, connected to family
✓ None are in long-term detention
✓ All received support no service provided
✓ Success came from relationships, not programs

**The Need:**

"I need voices behind me," Aunty Corrine says. "Not just funding. Voices."

Not another service extracting data. Not more tick-and-flick programs.

Voices. Decision-making power. Infrastructure that communities control.
