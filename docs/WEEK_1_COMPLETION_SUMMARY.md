### 3. AI Discovery Tool Built ✅

**[alma-source-discovery.mjs](file:///Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/scripts/alma-source-discovery.mjs)**
- Extracts Oochiumpa patterns (keywords, outcomes, structure)
- Uses Claude to analyze NT Aboriginal organization websites
- Scores program similarity (0-100)
- Discovers programs undocumented by government

**Current Status**: Running AI discovery on 4 NT seed URLs
- NAAJA (North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency)
- AMSANT (Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT)
- APO NT (Aboriginal Peak Organisations NT)
- CAFS (Central Australian Family Services)

## The Strategic Shift

### Traditional Model (What We DIDN'T Do)

```
Government programs (default)
  ↓
Academic research (validates government)
  ↓
NGO evaluations (supplements government)
  ↓
Community programs (footnotes, "promising")
  ↓
Aboriginal-led programs (tokenized, "culturally specific")
```

**Power**: Government departments define "what works"
**Funding**: Detention gets $XXX million, community programs compete for scraps
**Data ownership**: Government owns knowledge, communities provide "input"

---

### ALMA Model (What We DID)

```
Oochiumpa (Aboriginal-owned intelligence)
  ↓
AI discovers similar programs (pattern matching)
  ↓
Community partnerships (co-creation, not extraction)
  ↓
Government data (contextualized against Oochiumpa)
  ↓
Funder intelligence (Aboriginal programs prioritized)
```

**Power**: Aboriginal communities define "what works" (Community Authority = 30%, highest signal)
**Funding**: Intelligence shows proven alternatives (Oochiumpa vs detention outcomes)
**Data ownership**: Communities own knowledge, ALMA shares value (10% revenue)

---

## Who This Threatens (And Why That's The Point)

### 1. Government Youth Justice Departments
**Current narrative**: "We're evidence-based, professional, accountable"
**ALMA narrative**: "You spend $XXX million on detention. Oochiumpa gets better results for fraction of cost. Why?"
**Threat**: Budget justification collapses when compared to community alternatives

### 2. Mainstream NGOs (Non-Indigenous)
**Current narrative**: "We're the experts in youth services"
**ALMA narrative**: "Your Community Authority score is low. Oochiumpa's holistic model is more effective."
**Threat**: Funders redirect grants to Aboriginal-led programs

### 3. Academic Researchers
**Current narrative**: "We need RCTs to prove what works"
**ALMA narrative**: "Oochiumpa's evaluation (n=21, 6 months) shows 95% reduction. That's stronger than your 3-year RCT with 60% re-offending."
**Threat**: Community-generated evidence challenges academic gatekeeping

### 4. Detention Industry
**Current narrative**: "Detention is necessary for public safety"
**ALMA narrative**: "Oochiumpa diverted 18 of 19 young people from offending list. Detention is a failure by comparison."
**Threat**: Existential - if community alternatives scale, detention contracts disappear

---

## What This Enables

### For Youth Using JusticeHub

**Before ALMA**:
- Services listed alphabetically or by location
- No indication of which actually work
- Government programs shown first (default)

**With ALMA**:
- Services ranked by Community Authority + Evidence
- Oochiumpa rated ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Aboriginal-owned, 95% success)
- Government programs rated lower (compliance-focused, 60% completion)

**Impact**: Youth self-select into culturally safe, proven programs

---

### For Funders

**Before ALMA**:
- Ask: "What programs should we invest in?"
- Get: Government reports (detention, supervision)
- Fund: More of the same

**With ALMA Intelligence Pack**:
- **Section 1**: What's Working (Oochiumpa + similar programs, Aboriginal-owned)
- **Section 2**: Funding Gaps (proven programs at-risk, detention overfunded)
- **Section 3**: What's NOT Working (detention 40% re-offending, high cost)
- **Section 4**: Replication Opportunities (how to scale Oochiumpa model)

**Impact**: Funders can't ignore that detention is expensive failure, Oochiumpa is proven success

---

### For Policy Makers

**Before ALMA**:
- "Raise the Age" campaign has emotional stories
- Policy makers ask: "What's the alternative?"
- No data-backed answer

**With ALMA**:
- Oochiumpa achieved 95% offending reduction
- Cost: $X per participant vs $XXX,000 per year in detention
- Alternative exists, is proven, is Aboriginal-owned

**Impact**: Policy change becomes feasible (alternative is proven, costed, community-owned)

---

## Next Steps (Week 2)

### 1. Review AI Discovery Results
- **Goal**: Find 5-10 programs similar to Oochiumpa in NT
- **Outcome**: Contact organizations for partnership
- **Timeline**: Complete by end of Week 2

### 2. Send Partnership Outreach
- **Oochiumpa**: Verify consent, permission to use as exemplar
- **NATSILS/SNAICC**: National authority, consent framework guidance
- **NAAJA/APO NT**: NT partnerships, co-create intelligence
- **Timeline**: Send emails Week 1, schedule calls Week 2

### 3. NT Government Baseline Scraping
- **Sources**: Royal Commission reports, AIHW data, Productivity Commission
- **Goal**: Document government programs for comparison to Oochiumpa
- **Timeline**: Week 2

### 4. Build Intelligence Pack Template
- **For**: Aboriginal organizations (free)
- **Contents**: What exists, what's missing, replication opportunities, funding gaps
- **Timeline**: Draft Week 3, deliver Week 12

## The Philosophy in Action

### ACT Development Philosophy Realized

From [ACT_DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md](file:///Users/benknight/act-global-infrastructure/act-personal-ai/ACT_DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md):

**1. Cultural Sovereignty is Sacred**
✅ OCAP enforced in code (Community Authority field, hard blocks, consent ledger)
✅ Oochiumpa owns data (consent revocable, 10% revenue share)
✅ Stories not duplicated (cross-database reference only)

**2. Observe Systems, Never Optimize People**
✅ ALMA tracks interventions (programs, policies), not youth
✅ No "risk scores" or "engagement metrics"
✅ System pressure tracked (detention spending, funding gaps)

**3. Hard Blocks Over Soft Warnings**
✅ Sacred fields throw errors (not warnings)
✅ Community Controlled interventions MUST have cultural_authority field
✅ Consent required before Aboriginal data used (enforced at database level)

**6. Regenerative Over Extractive**
✅ Revenue flows back to communities (10% to Oochiumpa)
✅ Intelligence FOR Aboriginal orgs first (free), funders pay
✅ Knowledge flows both ways (Oochiumpa insights → AI discovery → more Aboriginal programs found)

---

## What We're Building

ALMA isn't just a database of youth justice programs.

It's a **new infrastructure for knowledge production** where:

1. **Indigenous intelligence is centered** (not as "input" but as the benchmark)
2. **Revenue is redistributed** (communities profit from their knowledge)
3. **Epistemic hierarchies are challenged** (community evaluation > academic RCTs when outcomes are clear)
4. **Policy shifts are enabled** (proven alternatives make "Raise the Age" feasible)
5. **Value scales regeneratively** (the more Aboriginal orgs participate, the more valuable the intelligence, the more revenue flows back)

---

## The Critical Insight

**We don't start from zero.**

We start from **Oochiumpa's proven 72% school re-engagement and 95% offending reduction**.

**This is the benchmark.**

Everything else is discovered in relation to this Aboriginal-owned success story.
