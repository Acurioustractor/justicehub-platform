# JusticeHub: Simplified Pitch & Post-June 2026 Roadmap

**For:** Mindaroo Foundation (and aligned funders)
**Date:** February 2026
**Focus:** Post-PRF Fellowship trajectory (July 2026 onwards)

---

## The Simple Story

**Problem:** Communities know what works in youth justice. But their knowledge stays local, uncompensated, and invisible to decision-makers.

**Solution:** JusticeHub is permanent infrastructure that helps communities translate their solutions into policy influence—and gets them paid when their knowledge creates value.

**The twist:** Indigenous communities set the standard. If we build infrastructure that protects Indigenous knowledge properly, we protect everyone.

---

## What Makes This Different (In Plain Language)

| Instead of... | JusticeHub does... |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Research *about* communities | Infrastructure *owned by* communities |
| Consultants extracting stories | Revenue-sharing when stories create value |
| Programs that end when funding ends | Permanent platform that reduces dependency |
| One-off consultations | Sustained economic participation |

---

## The Three-Year Journey (Simplified)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Now - June 2026)
**Focus:** PRF Fellowship + Mindaroo Year 1 overlap
- Contained installations in 3 communities
- JusticeHub onboarding 10 grassroots orgs
- Research: Does physical + digital integration work?
- **Key milestone:** Prove communities can earn from their knowledge

### Phase 2: International Learning (June - August 2026)
**Your international trip:** Not a holiday. A research mission.
- **Spain:** Diagrama Foundation (73% success rate, 3% reoffending)
- **Potential:** Netherlands, Norway (lowest youth incarceration in Europe)
- **Goal:** Document what Australia can learn + what JusticeHub could export
- **Output:** International comparison report + potential partnerships

### Phase 3: Scale & Ownership (September 2026 - 2028)
**Focus:** Post-fellowship, post-international learning
- Apply international insights to Australian context
- Scale to 20+ communities
- Revenue model stress-test: Does money actually flow to communities?
- Prepare ownership transfer to community-governed structure

---

## Post-June 2026: The Real Roadmap

### Immediate After International Trip (September 2026)

**Deliverable:** "What Australia Can Learn" report
- International models applicable to Australian context
- Specific recommendations for JusticeHub platform improvements
- Partnership agreements with international organizations

**Site updates:**
- `/international-exchange` page documenting learnings
- Video series: "Justice Systems That Work"
- Comparative analysis tool: Australia vs. international models

### Year 2 (2027): Community Revenue Proof

**The question we're answering:** 
Can communities actually earn sustainable income from their knowledge?

**Metrics:**
- $50K+ distributed to communities via story licensing
- 5 communities earning >$5K/year from platform
- 1 community-owned organization managing their own JusticeHub content independently

**Site simplification:**
- Focus on 3 core journeys:
  1. **For Communities:** "Share your solution, get paid"
  2. **For Practitioners:** "Find what works"
  3. **For Funders:** "See your impact"

### Year 3 (2028): Ownership Transfer

**The handover:**
- Legal structure: Community-governed trust or ACCO
- Indigenous Advisory Board has veto power on all decisions
- A Curious Tractor becomes service provider, not owner
- JusticeHub operates independently with 60-70% self-sustainability

---

## Site Architecture: Simplified for Clarity

### Current Problem: Too Many Paths
The site has 50+ pages. Visitors get lost. Funders can't see the through-line.

### Proposed Simplified Structure (Post-June 2026):

```
justicehub.org/
├── /                         # Homepage: One powerful story
├── /communities              # For communities: "Share & earn"
│   ├── /submit-story
│   ├── /revenue-share
│   └── /case-studies
├── /solutions                # For practitioners: "Find what works"
│   ├── /programs
│   ├── /evidence
│   └── /international        # Your trip learnings live here
├── /collaborate              # For partners: "Join the movement"
│   ├── /funders
│   ├── /researchers
│   └── /international        # Partnership opportunities
├── /about                    # The story, the team, the vision
│   ├── /roadmap              # Clear 2026-2028 timeline
│   └── /impact               # Real metrics, real communities
└── /contained                # The installation journey
    ├── /tour
    ├── /host
    └── /research             # Fellowship findings
```

**Pages to consolidate/retire:**
- Remove duplicate pitch documents (keep one canonical Mindaroo pitch)
- Consolidate wiki content into main site navigation
- Archive outdated PRF application materials (keep for reference, not public)
- Merge multiple "about" pages into single clear story

---

## The International Trip: Strategic Value

### Why June 2026 Timing Matters

1. **PRF Fellowship ends:** August 2027 (18 months from March 2026)
2. **International trip:** June 2026 = perfect midpoint inflection
3. **Mindaroo Year 1 ends:** December 2026
4. **Result:** International learnings inform both fellowship second half AND Mindaroo Year 2

### Deliverables from Trip

**Content:**
- Video interviews with international practitioners
- Documentation of models transferable to Australia
- Case studies: "What Works in [Country]"

**Partnerships:**
- Formal relationships with 2-3 international organizations
- Potential for JusticeHub to host international best practice database
- Exchange programs: Australian practitioners visit international sites

**Platform Features:**
- International comparison tool on JusticeHub
- "Could this work here?" analysis framework
- Global youth justice network connection

---

## Revenue Model: The Simple Version

### How Communities Earn

1. **Story Licensing:** When media uses community stories, 50% goes to storyteller
2. **Program Certification:** JusticeHub verifies community programs; orgs pay for certification
3. **Research Partnerships:** Universities pay to access community knowledge; communities get co-authorship + payment
4. **Training:** Communities deliver training based on their expertise; keep majority of fees

### Sustainability Trajectory

| Year | Revenue | Philanthropic Need | Self-Sustaining |
|------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 2026 | $100K | $3M | 3% |
| 2027 | $400K | $2.5M | 16% |
| 2028 | $800K | $1.5M | 53% |
| 2029+ | $1M+ | <$1M | 75%+ |

---

## The Ask: Simplified

**Mindaroo Foundation:** $3.5M over 3 years (2026-2028)

**What this funds:**
- Community payments: $1.8M (direct to communities)
- Platform development: $600K
- Operations: $600K
- International learning & partnerships: $300K
- Evaluation & research: $200K

**What success looks like:**

## The Long Game: 2036 Vision

**JusticeHub in 2036:**
- Community-owned and governed
- International network: Australia, NZ, Canada, potentially others
- $10M+/year flowing to community programs
- Youth justice system transformed: detention as last resort, not default

**But more importantly:**
- Communities control their own narratives
- Knowledge creators are compensated fairly
- Systems change because communities lead, not because researchers convince

---

## Connection to Your Work

**PRF Fellowship (March 2026 - August 2027):** Tests whether physical + digital integration works

**International Trip (June 2026):** Provides global context and partnerships

**Mindaroo Funding (2026-2028):** Scales what works, builds permanent infrastructure

**The through-line:** Community ownership as the foundation for systems change

---

## One-Page Summary for Funders

**JusticeHub creates permanent infrastructure that helps communities translate their solutions into policy influence—and gets them paid when their knowledge creates value.**

**Why Indigenous leadership?** If we build infrastructure that protects Indigenous knowledge properly, we protect everyone.

**The 3-year arc:**
- Year 1: Prove the model (PRF + Mindaroo overlap)
- International trip: Learn from global best practice (June 2026)
- Years 2-3: Scale and transfer ownership

**The ask:** $3.5M to build infrastructure that lasts forever, owned by communities.

**The outcome:** Communities control their narratives, earn from their knowledge, and lead systems change.
