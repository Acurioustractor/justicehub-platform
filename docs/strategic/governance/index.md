# JusticeHub Governance Documentation

**Status**: Active
**Last Updated**: January 2, 2026
**Purpose**: Ethical governance framework for JusticeHub operations

---

## Overview

JusticeHub is infrastructure designed to transfer to community ownership. These governance documents ensure that intention becomes reality.

**Core Principles**:
- Indigenous communities are foundational knowledge holders, not advisory participants
- Revenue flows to communities, not just the platform
- Power stays distributed, never centralized
- Ethics are enforced in code, not just policy

## Governance Principles

### Power Distribution

```
Community → IAB → JusticeHub Board → Operations
    ↑          ↑          ↑             ↑
  Source    Authority   Strategy    Execution
```

- Communities are the source of knowledge and legitimacy
- IAB has governance authority (veto power)
- JusticeHub Board sets strategy
- Operations executes within constraints

### Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Who Decides | Who Must Approve |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| Indigenous data sharing | Community | IAB veto |
| Government partnerships | Board | IAB veto + Ethical Review |
| Corporate sponsorships | Board | Ethical Review |
| Research partnerships | Board | IAB veto + Community co-authorship |
| Revenue distribution | Board | IAB audit |
| Platform features | Product | /act-code-reviewer |

### Revenue Flow Requirements

| Stream | Minimum to Community |
|--------|---------------------|
| Government Licenses | 30% |
| Corporate Sponsorships | 40% |
| Research Partnerships | 50% |
| Story Licensing | 50% to storyteller |

## Success Criteria

### We succeed if:

1. **IAB is operational by Month 3** with real authority
2. **All partnerships pass ethical review** before signing
3. **Revenue flows to communities** as promised
4. **Tasmania coverage complete** by Month 1
5. **10-year justice metrics** published and tracked

### We fail if:

1. **IAB becomes advisory** (no veto power exercised)
2. **Harmful partnerships** approved for revenue
3. **Revenue stays in platform** (not flowing to community)
4. **Tasmania still missing** after Month 2
5. **No justice system metrics** (only platform metrics)
