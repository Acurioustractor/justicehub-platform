# 10-Year Justice System Metrics: 2026-2036

**Date**: January 2, 2026
**Status**: Draft for Leadership Review
**Purpose**: Define what success looks like for the Australian youth justice system, not just the JusticeHub platform

---

## The Critical Gap This Document Addresses

JusticeHub has a clear platform vision:
- Community-owned by Year 5
- Internationally expanded by Year 10
- Self-sustaining revenue model

**But JusticeHub could become a successful platform supporting an unjust system.**

This document defines what must change in Australian youth justice itself.

## 2026 Baseline: Where We Are

### Current State (January 2026)

| Metric | Current Reality | Source |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Indigenous youth incarceration rate** | 24x higher than non-Indigenous | AIHW 2024 |
| **Youth in community vs detention** | ~25% community, ~75% detention pathway | State reports |
| **Average age of first detention** | 14.2 years | AIHW 2024 |
| **Recidivism rate (12 months)** | ~50% return to custody | State data |
| **Community Controlled interventions** | <15% of total youth justice programs | JusticeHub estimate |
| **Indigenous staff in youth justice** | <10% of workforce | State data |
| **Youth voice in system design** | Minimal, advisory at best | Assessment |

### Why These Numbers Matter

**24x Indigenous incarceration rate** = Systemic racism, not individual failure
**75% detention pathway** = System defaulting to punishment, not healing
**50% recidivism** = Detention doesn't work; communities do
**<15% Community Controlled** = Funding flows to mainstream, not community

---

## 2036 Vision: What Success Looks Like

### The Success Statement

> "In 2036, the Australian youth justice system operates on the principle that communities—not detention—are the solution. Most youth never see a courtroom. Indigenous communities control how justice is delivered in their regions. JusticeHub is permanent infrastructure owned by those communities."

## 10-Year Justice System Metrics

### Metric Family 1: Diversion Success

**What we're measuring**: Are youth being diverted from detention to community?

| Metric | 2026 Baseline | 2031 Target (5yr) | 2036 Target (10yr) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Youth justice encounters resolved in community | 25% | 50% | **75%** |
| Youth under 14 in detention | ~200/year | <50/year | **Zero** |
| Youth under 16 in detention | ~800/year | <200/year | **<50/year** |
| Average time from encounter to community resolution | 6+ months | 3 months | **30 days** |
| Police diversion rate (vs charge) | ~40% | 60% | **80%** |

**Success indicator**: If a young person has contact with the justice system, the default is community resolution, not court.

### Metric Family 2: Indigenous Parity

**What we're measuring**: Is the racial injustice closing?

| Metric | 2026 Baseline | 2031 Target (5yr) | 2036 Target (10yr) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Indigenous youth incarceration ratio | 24x non-Indigenous | 12x | **<5x** (path to parity) |
| Indigenous youth on remand ratio | 20x non-Indigenous | 10x | **<4x** |
| Funding to Community Controlled programs | <15% | 35% | **50%+** |
| Indigenous communities with self-determination over justice | <5% | 25% | **50%** |
| Indigenous staff in youth justice sector | <10% | 25% | **40%** |

**Success indicator**: The ratio between Indigenous and non-Indigenous incarceration is closing year-over-year, with a trajectory toward parity.

**Note**: True parity (1:1 ratio) may require 20+ years of systemic change. The 10-year goal is demonstrable progress, not completion.

### Metric Family 3: Recidivism Reduction

**What we're measuring**: Does the system prevent re-offense?

| Metric | 2026 Baseline | 2031 Target (5yr) | 2036 Target (10yr) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 12-month recidivism rate | ~50% | 35% | **25%** |
| 5-year reoffending rate | ~70% | 50% | **35%** |
| Youth with stable housing post-release | ~40% | 60% | **80%** |
| Youth in education/employment post-release | ~30% | 50% | **70%** |
| Family reunification success rate | ~45% | 60% | **75%** |

**Success indicator**: Recidivism is a system failure metric. If recidivism stays high, the system is failing, not the young person.

### Metric Family 4: Community Power

**What we're measuring**: Do communities control their own justice?

| Metric | 2026 Baseline | 2031 Target (5yr) | 2036 Target (10yr) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Communities with final decision on intervention funding | <10% | 40% | **75%** |
| Youth justice workers from affected communities | <20% | 40% | **60%** |
| Government requests community approval for policy changes | Never | Pilot in 2 states | **Standard in all states** |
| Community Controlled programs financially sustainable | <20% | 50% | **80%** |
| Indigenous organizations controlling their own data | <10% | 50% | **80%** |

**Success indicator**: Power flows to communities, not just money. Communities decide, not just advise.

### Metric Family 5: Economic Impact

**What we're measuring**: Does the system create economic opportunity?

| Metric | 2026 Baseline | 2031 Target (5yr) | 2036 Target (10yr) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Annual revenue flowing to community programs via JusticeHub | $0 | $500K | **$10M+** |
| Indigenous youth employed in justice sector | <50 | 200 | **500+** |
| Community programs financially sustainable without grants | <20 | 50 | **100+** |
| Indigenous-owned businesses supporting youth programs | <10 | 30 | **75+** |
| Average Indigenous family economic improvement post-program | Unmeasured | Baseline set | **20% improvement** |

**Success indicator**: The justice system becomes an economic engine for communities, not a drain.

## JusticeHub's Role in Achieving These Metrics

### What JusticeHub Directly Influences

| System Metric | JusticeHub Contribution |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Community-resolved encounters | Surface high-evidence community programs for diversion |
| Indigenous parity | Track disparity signals; fund Community Controlled programs |
| Recidivism reduction | Connect youth to evidence-backed interventions |
| Community power | Build infrastructure that communities own |
| Economic impact | Flow revenue to communities; employ Indigenous staff |

### What JusticeHub Cannot Control

- Government policy decisions
- Police behavior
- Court sentencing
- State budget allocations
- Entrenched systemic racism

**JusticeHub's role is to make the right decisions easier, not to make decisions for the system.**

---

## How We Track Progress

### Annual Justice System Report

JusticeHub will publish annually:

1. **Diversion Scorecard**: Encounters resolved in community vs detention
2. **Indigenous Parity Index**: Year-over-year ratio change
3. **Recidivism Trends**: 12-month and 5-year rates by intervention type
4. **Community Power Audit**: Who controls funding, decisions, data
5. **Economic Flow Map**: Where money goes, who benefits

### Data Sources

| Metric Area | Primary Sources |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Diversion | AIHW Youth Justice reports, state data |
| Indigenous parity | AIHW Indigenous data, state reports |
| Recidivism | State corrections data, AIHW |
| Community power | JusticeHub internal, community surveys |
| Economic impact | JusticeHub revenue data, community reporting |

## What If We Fail?

### Early Warning Indicators

| Warning Sign | Response |
|--------------|----------|
| Diversion rate stalls (<5% annual improvement) | Increase advocacy investment; publish state comparisons |
| Indigenous ratio widens | Escalate to IAB; consider public campaign |
| Recidivism unchanged after 3 years | Review intervention evidence; adjust funding priorities |
| Community power metrics regress | Audit partnerships; increase Indigenous leadership |
| Revenue doesn't flow to communities | Revise revenue model; IAB intervention |

### Pivot Points

If 5-year targets are not on track:

1. **Double investment in advocacy** (policy change is blocking)
2. **Shift funding away from government partnerships** (if complicit in failure)
3. **Prioritize international expansion** (if Australia proves intractable)
4. **Transfer full control to Indigenous governance** (accelerate ownership)

---

## The Hard Truth

**These metrics require systemic change, not just platform success.**

JusticeHub can:
- Surface evidence that community programs work
- Flow resources to Indigenous-led solutions
- Track whether the system is changing
- Advocate for policy reform
- Build infrastructure communities own

JusticeHub cannot:
- Change laws (communities and advocates must)
- Force governments to fund community (politics must)
- Eliminate racism (generations of work required)
- Guarantee success (uncertainty is real)

**But if JusticeHub doesn't try—if it just builds a successful platform—then it becomes complicit in the system it claims to challenge.**

---

## Commitment

By adopting these metrics, JusticeHub commits to:

1. **Measuring the system, not just the platform**
2. **Publishing annual progress (including failures)**
3. **Adjusting strategy based on justice outcomes, not just revenue**
4. **Transferring ownership to communities as a success condition, not an exit strategy**
5. **Being accountable to Indigenous communities, not just funders**
