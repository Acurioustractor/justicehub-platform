# Partnership Ethical Review Process

**Date**: January 2, 2026
**Status**: Implementation Ready
**Purpose**: Establish clear ethical review process for all JusticeHub partnerships

---

## Why This Exists

Revenue is necessary for sustainability. But not all revenue is ethical.

**Risks without governance**:
- Government uses ALMA intelligence for surveillance
- Corporations use sponsorship for greenwashing
- Research extracts knowledge without community benefit
- Citation fees become hidden tax on community fundraising

**This process ensures every dollar aligns with JusticeHub's mission.**

---

## Partnership Categories

### Category A: Government Partnerships
**Examples**: State government ALMA licenses, policy consultation contracts

**Risk Level**: HIGH
- Can enable surveillance
- Can co-opt community intelligence
- Can legitimize unjust systems

**Review Required**: IAB approval + ethical review committee

### Category B: Corporate Sponsorships
**Examples**: Atlassian sponsoring Education/Employment interventions, law firm sponsoring Legal Aid category

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- Greenwashing risk
- Brand association risk
- Dependency risk

**Review Required**: Ethical review committee

### Category C: Research Partnerships
**Examples**: University licensing ALMA data, research collaboration

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Knowledge extraction risk
- Publication without community consent
- Indigenous data sovereignty

**Review Required**: IAB approval + community co-authorship requirement

### Category D: Philanthropic Grants
**Examples**: Mindaroo, Paul Ramsay Foundation, Gandel

**Risk Level**: LOW-MEDIUM
- Funder influence on priorities
- Dependency on single source
- Reporting burden

**Review Required**: Standard review

### Category E: Story/Media Licensing
**Examples**: Publishers licensing storyteller narratives, documentary rights

**Risk Level**: LOW
- Storyteller consent already built-in
- Revenue flows to storyteller

**Review Required**: Storyteller consent only
