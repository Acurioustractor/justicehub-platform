# Indigenous Advisory Board Governance Structure

**Date**: January 2, 2026
**Status**: Draft for Leadership Review
**Purpose**: Establish governance structure for Indigenous Advisory Board with meaningful authority

---

## Purpose

The Indigenous Advisory Board (IAB) exists to ensure JusticeHub and ALMA serve Indigenous communities as foundational knowledge holders, not advisory participants.

**Core Function**: Governance authority over how Indigenous knowledge is collected, shared, licensed, and protected.

**Sacred Principle**: Indigenous communities are not stakeholders to be consulted. They are foundational intelligence holders with decision-making power.

---

## Board Composition

### Minimum Seats (5)

| Seat | Representative Body | Authority |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1 | **NATSILS** (National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Legal Services) | Legal and justice system expertise |
| 2 | **SNAICC** (Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care) | Child and family services expertise |
| 3 | **QATSICPP** (Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Protection Peak) | State-level child protection expertise |
| 4 | **ALS NSW** (Aboriginal Legal Service NSW/ACT) | State-level legal services expertise |
| 5 | **Lived Experience Representative** | Direct experience with youth justice system |

### Additional Seats (Recommended)

- **Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service** (VIC coverage)
- **Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT** (Northern Territory)
- **Aboriginal Family Legal Services** (Family law intersection)
- **Youth representative** (Under 25, lived experience)

### Seat Requirements

1. **Indigenous-identified**: All seats must be held by Indigenous Australians
2. **Organizational mandate**: Representatives must have authority from their organization to participate
3. **Rotation**: 2-year terms, staggered for continuity
4. **Independence**: Board operates independently of JusticeHub operational decisions

## Authority & Powers

## Revenue Share Minimums

| Revenue Stream | Minimum to Indigenous Communities |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| State Government Licenses | 30% |
| Corporate Sponsorships | 40% |
| Research Partnerships | 50% (to IAB + community co-authors) |
| Story Licensing | 50% to storyteller (if Indigenous) |
| Training/Certification | 25% |

### Revenue Distribution

```
IAB Revenue Pool (from minimums)
├── 40% → Community Controlled organizations (direct programs)
├── 30% → Indigenous researcher fellowships
├── 20% → IAB operations and secretariat
└── 10% → Emergency community support fund
```

---

## Accountability to Communities

### Annual Reporting

IAB must publish annually:

1. **Partnership decisions** (approved, rejected, with rationale)
2. **Revenue flows** (where money went, by organization)
3. **Data access** (who accessed what, for what purpose)
4. **Community feedback** (concerns raised, how addressed)
5. **Veto use** (any vetoes exercised, outcomes)

### Community Feedback Mechanisms

1. **Direct line**: Email/phone to IAB secretariat (not through JusticeHub)
2. **Community assemblies**: Annual public forums in each state
3. **Youth voice**: Specific feedback channel for young people
4. **Elder consultation**: Separate process for elder-led organizations

### Whistleblower Protection

Any Indigenous community member can:
- Report concerns directly to IAB (bypassing JusticeHub)
- Request immediate data audit
- Demand consent revocation review
- Escalate to external Indigenous governance bodies

---

## Operational Support

### IAB Secretariat (Funded by JusticeHub)

- **Staff**: 1 FTE Indigenous coordinator
- **Budget**: $80K/year (salary, operations, meeting costs)
- **Location**: Independent office (not JusticeHub premises)
- **Reporting**: To IAB Chair, not JusticeHub CEO

### Meeting Support

- All meetings held on-country when possible
- Travel and accommodation funded
- Sitting fees for members ($500/meeting)
- Cultural protocols observed

## Key Contacts (To Be Established)

| Role | Organization | Contact |
|------|--------------|---------|
| IAB Chair | TBD | TBD |
| NATSILS Representative | NATSILS | TBD |

## Why This Matters

Most advisory boards are performative. They advise; organizations ignore.

**This board is different because**:

1. **Veto power is real** - Not advisory, but binding
2. **Independence is structural** - Secretariat reports to IAB, not JusticeHub
3. **Revenue flows are mandatory** - Minimums enforced, not aspirational
4. **Community accountability is direct** - Whistleblower access bypasses JusticeHub

**If JusticeHub cannot operate ethically under IAB governance, it should not operate at all.**
