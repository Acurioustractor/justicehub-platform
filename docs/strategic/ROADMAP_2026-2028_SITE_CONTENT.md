### Phase 1: Prove It (2026)

**Timeline:** January - December 2026

**What We're Doing:**
- PRF Fellowship research: Testing whether Contained installations + JusticeHub platform create deeper engagement than either alone
- Launching Contained in 3 communities
- Onboarding 10 grassroots organizations to JusticeHub
- Learning how communities want to tell their stories

**Key Question:** Does this integration actually work?

**Milestones:**
- [x] Fellowship begins (March 2026)
- [ ] Contained installation #1 complete
- [ ] First community payment via revenue-sharing
- [ ] International trip (June 2026)
- [ ] Mid-year community feedback report

**Mindaroo Funding:** Year 1 ($1M)
- Community payments and story collection: $600K
- Platform development: $200K
- Operations: $200K

---

### The International Trip: June 2026

**Not a holiday. A research mission.**

**Why we're going:**
Australia doesn't have all the answers. Countries like Spain, Norway, and New Zealand have youth justice systems that work better. We need to learn from them.

**Where we're going:**
- **Spain:** Diagrama Foundation (73% success rate, 3% reoffending)
- **Netherlands:** Diversion-focused youth justice
- **Potentially:** Norway (lowest incarceration rate in Europe)

**What we're bringing back:**
- Documented models transferable to Australia
- Video interviews with international practitioners
- Partnership agreements for ongoing knowledge exchange
- Recommendations for JusticeHub platform improvements

**How this connects:**
The trip happens at the midpoint—after proving the model works, before scaling it. International learnings inform both the second half of the fellowship AND the scale-up phase.

---

### Phase 2: Scale It (2027)

**Timeline:** January - December 2027

**What We're Doing:**
- Apply international learnings to Australian context
- Scale from 3 communities to 20+
- Prove the revenue model: Can communities earn sustainable income?
- Build partnerships with international organizations

**Key Question:** Can communities actually earn from their knowledge?

**Milestones:**
- [ ] 20+ communities on JusticeHub
- [ ] $50K+ distributed to communities
- [ ] 5 communities earning >$5K/year
- [ ] International partnership agreements signed
- [ ] Revenue model transparency report published

**Mindaroo Funding:** Year 2 ($1.25M)
- Community payments: $700K
- Platform scaling: $300K
- International partnerships: $150K
- Operations: $100K

---

### Phase 3: Own It (2028)

**Timeline:** January - December 2028

**What We're Doing:**
- Transfer legal ownership to community-governed structure
- Indigenous Advisory Board operational with veto power
- A Curious Tractor becomes service provider, not owner
- JusticeHub operates independently

**Key Question:** Does community ownership actually work?

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Legal transfer complete
- [ ] Community governance board established
- [ ] 60-70% operational self-sustainability achieved
- [ ] Platform operates independently of founders

**Mindaroo Funding:** Year 3 ($1.25M)
- Community payments and governance transition: $500K
- Platform independence: $400K
- Operations: $350K

---

### The Long View: 2036

**JusticeHub in 2036:**
- Community-owned and governed
- $10M+/year flowing to community programs
- International network: Australia, NZ, Canada, and beyond
- Youth justice system transformed

**But more importantly:**
Communities control their own narratives. Knowledge creators are compensated fairly. Systems change because communities lead.
