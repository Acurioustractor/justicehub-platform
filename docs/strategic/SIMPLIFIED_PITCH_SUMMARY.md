# Simplified Mindaroo Pitch & Site Alignment Summary

**Completed:** February 9, 2026

---

## What Was Created

### 1. Simplified Pitch Document
**File:** `/docs/strategic/MINDAROO_SIMPLIFIED_PITCH_2026.md`

**Key simplifications:**
- Reduced from 20,000 words to ~2,500 words
- Clear 3-year arc: Prove It → International Learning → Scale It → Own It
- Integrated PRF Fellowship, Mindaroo funding, and international trip into one narrative
- Simple revenue model showing path to 75% self-sustainability
- Clear ask: $3.5M over 3 years

**The core story:**
> Communities know what works in youth justice. But their knowledge stays local, uncompensated, and invisible. JusticeHub creates permanent infrastructure that helps communities translate their solutions into policy influence—and gets them paid when their knowledge creates value.
