## Critical Success Factors

### Must-Haves

✅ **Clear innovation:** Physical + digital integration is pioneering work not explored in Australia
✅ **Community partnership:** Co-research model, not extraction; communities benefit economically
✅ **Systems change focus:** Researching conditions (hearts/minds, resources, policies) not just programs
✅ **PRF alignment:** Every answer connects to PRF outcomes, values, principles
✅ **Personal connection:** Your story of why this matters is authentic and compelling

### Red Flags to Avoid

❌ Positioning this as service delivery or tech project (it's RESEARCH into systems change)
❌ Academic jargon (write accessibly for diverse reviewers)
❌ Vague community engagement (be specific about partnerships)
❌ Missing the integration (emphasize how physical + digital work together)
❌ Extraction mindset (communities must own, benefit, lead)

---

## Your Core Message

**If you only remember one thing, remember this:**

> "This fellowship researches how communities can OWN the infrastructure of knowledge production (physical installations + digital platforms + economic participation) so they can lead systems change themselves—shifting hearts & minds, resource allocation, and policy from incarceration to community support."

**Why it matters:**

> "Because we already know community-based programs work better than detention. The question is: How do we create the CONDITIONS for systems to adopt them? This fellowship researches exactly that—with communities in the lead."

---

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: "I'm not sure which host organization to choose"

**Solution:**
- Approach 3 options in parallel
- Ask PRF for support (they help match fellows to hosts)
- In application, note: "In discussion with [organization names], open to PRF support for host match"

### Challenge: "I don't have all the community partnerships confirmed yet"

**Solution:**
- Name organizations you're in conversation with
- Be honest: "Early discussions with [org names], will formalize if fellowship awarded"
- Demonstrate you have relationships, even if not formal MOUs

### Challenge: "The budget feels complicated"

**Solution:**
- Use high-level categories from draft responses document
- PRF will work with you to refine budget if selected
- Focus on: your time, community compensation, installation costs, platform development

### Challenge: "I'm worried this is too ambitious"

**Solution:**
- This fellowship is MEANT for ambitious, pioneering ideas
- PRF specifically seeks to "fill knowledge gaps" and "identify new ways"
- Your ambition matches PRF's mandate
- The integration IS the innovation—it's supposed to be big

### Challenge: "What if I don't get shortlisted?"

**Solution:**
- The research is valuable regardless of funding
- Consider other funders (this strategy document helps any application)
- PRF offers this biannually—could apply in 2027
- Feedback strengthens future applications
