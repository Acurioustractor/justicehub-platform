**On Innovation:**
"Physical embodied experience PLUS ongoing digital engagement—testing whether integration creates deeper systems change than either alone."

**On Community:**
"Communities are co-researchers who own the infrastructure, edit AI outputs, and benefit economically when stories create value."

**On Research:**
"We know programs work. The question: What CONDITIONS enable systems to adopt them?"

**On Timing:**
"Contained launches Oct 2025. Fellowship starts March 2026. Youth justice reform is active NOW. This is the moment."
