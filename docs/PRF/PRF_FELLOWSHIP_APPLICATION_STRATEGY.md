# PRF Fellowship Application Strategy
## JusticeHub x Contained: Systems Change Through Story and Place

---

## Executive Summary

This fellowship proposal positions **you** as a practice-led researcher exploring how **digital storytelling platforms (JusticeHub) and immersive community art installations (Contained)** can work together to create the conditions for systems change in youth justice and community self-determination.

**The Core Proposition:** Communities hold the knowledge, stories, and solutions to break cycles of disadvantage. But systemic barriers—in hearts & minds, resource allocation, and policy—prevent community wisdom from shifting practice. This fellowship researches how **dual-mode engagement** (physical installation + digital platform) can bridge the gap between lived experience and systems change.

---

## Alignment with PRF Strategic Outcomes

### Primary Alignment: Children and Young People Have Positive Life Paths Free from Entrenched Poverty and Harm

**Direct Connection:**
- **Contained** directly addresses youth justice system transformation, demonstrating that incarceration creates worse outcomes than community-based alternatives
- **JusticeHub** provides the infrastructure for young people and their communities to share their stories with dignity, ownership, and financial participation
- Research will document **how** story-based interventions shift conditions from harm to support

### Secondary Alignment: Places and Communities Are Connected, Imagining and Leading Their Own Futures

**Direct Connection:**
- **Contained** is designed to be "hosted by communities" who "fill it with their solutions"
- **JusticeHub** enables community organizations to become knowledge producers, not just service deliverers
- Fellowship researches how communities move from being subjects of research to leaders of systems change

### Tertiary Alignment: First Nations Peoples and Communities Are Self-Determining

**Direct Connection:**
- First Nations young people are vastly overrepresented in youth detention (Indigenous methodology recognizes story as knowledge)
- **JusticeHub** ownership and revenue-sharing models directly support self-determination through economic participation
- Fellowship will center Indigenous knowledge systems as research methodology, not just research subject

---

## The Research Idea: Pioneering Work

### What Makes This Innovative?

**1. Integration of Physical and Digital for Systems Change**
- No existing research combines immersive art installations with AI-assisted digital storytelling platforms
- Tests hypothesis: **Multi-modal engagement** (embodied experience + ongoing digital connection) creates deeper systems change than either alone

**2. Story as Research Methodology**
- Challenges conventional "researcher studies community" model
- Positions communities as co-researchers, with story as primary evidence
- Tests: Can AI-assisted story extraction honor lived experience while accelerating knowledge dissemination?

**3. Economic Models for Community Knowledge**
- **JusticeHub's** revenue-sharing framework treats community stories as intellectual property deserving compensation
- Research question: Does economic participation in storytelling shift power dynamics in systems change?

**4. Reversing the Evidence Paradigm**
- **Contained** shows that "evidence" (statistics, cost comparisons) becomes meaningful when combined with story and embodied experience
- Tests: How does physical immersion in comparative evidence change hearts & minds differently than reports?

### What Gap Does This Fill?

**Current Gap:**
- Youth justice research focuses on programs OR policy OR public perception
- Community storytelling platforms focus on awareness OR advocacy
- Art installations focus on experience OR education
- **None integrate all three** + **test whether integration creates conditions for systems change**

**This Fellowship Fills:**
- How physical + digital storytelling creates conditions for policy shift
- How community ownership of narrative infrastructure affects resource allocation
- How lived experience becomes evidence that moves decision-makers
- How art + technology + story work together to shift hearts, minds, and systems

---

## Methodology: How Will You Explore This Idea?

### Phase 1: Establish Baseline (Months 1-3)
**Physical Component (Contained):**
- Launch installation in 3 communities (targeting areas with high youth incarceration rates)
- Document visitor responses, policy-maker engagement, media coverage
- Track: Who attends? What shifts in their understanding? What actions do they take?

**Digital Component (JusticeHub):**
- Implement AI-assisted storytelling pipeline with 10 community organizations
- Build ownership/revenue-sharing framework
- Document: How do storytellers experience the process? What barriers exist?

**Integration Research:**
- Test hypothesis: Does visiting Contained increase engagement with JusticeHub stories?
- Track: Do people who experience physical installation become digital community members?

### Phase 2: Deep Community Engagement (Months 4-9)
**Co-Research with Communities:**
- Partner with 5 communities hosting Contained
- Conduct story-gathering workshops where young people and families share experiences
- Use JusticeHub AI to extract themes, quotes, case studies from transcripts
- **Critical Step:** Communities review, edit, and approve extracted stories
- Document: How does AI-assisted extraction compare to traditional research methods in honoring lived experience?

**Systems Mapping:**
- Map the ecosystem around youth justice: decision-makers, funders, service providers, media
- Track how stories move through this system
- Document: Which storytelling formats (digital article, video, installation testimony) reach which audiences?

**Economic Modeling:**
- Implement revenue-sharing when stories are used by media, policymakers, researchers
- Document: How does financial participation affect community engagement? Trust? Agency?

### Phase 3: Testing Systems Change Hypotheses (Months 10-12)
**Policy Impact:**
- Work with communities to present findings to:
  - State/federal policymakers
  - Youth justice departments
  - Funding bodies
- Document: How do policymakers respond to community-generated evidence vs traditional research?

**Hearts & Minds Shift:**
- Measure: Media coverage, public discourse analysis, social media sentiment
- Track: How does narrative change from "tough on crime" to "community support"?

**Resource Flow:**
- Document: Does evidence of community solutions shift funding from detention to community programs?
- Track: Do organizations using JusticeHub gain new funding opportunities?

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Dissemination (Months 13-18)
**Months 13-15: Analysis**
- What conditions enabled systems change? (or prevented it?)
- How did physical + digital integration work (or not work)?
- What role did community ownership play?
- How did multiple knowledge systems (lived experience, creative practice, data) interact?

**Months 16-18: Dissemination**
- **For Communities:** Open-source playbook: "How to Host Contained + Build Your JusticeHub"
- **For Funders:** "Investing in Community Knowledge Infrastructure: Revenue-Sharing Models That Work"
- **For Policymakers:** "Evidence from the Inside: Why Community-Led Research Changes Policy"
- **For Sector:** "Beyond Storytelling: When Digital Platforms Become Sites of Self-Determination"

## Alignment with PRF Values and Principles

### Values

**Courage:**
- Challenges conventional researcher/subject power dynamics
- Tests economic models that redistribute resources to communities
- Proposes that art + technology can shift entrenched systems

**Curiosity:**
- Asks: How do different knowledge systems (lived experience, creative practice, AI-assisted analysis, evidence) work together?
- Tests: Can communities lead rigorous research that influences policy?

**Connection:**
- Physical installation creates embodied connection to evidence
- Digital platform creates ongoing connection to community narratives
- Fellowship creates connections across youth justice ecosystem

### Principles

**Agency:**
- Communities choose which stories to share, how to edit AI-extracted content, when to participate in revenue-sharing
- Young people control their narratives through consent and ownership frameworks
- Research is **with** communities, not **on** them

**Relationships:**
- Long-term partnerships with host communities (not extractive research)
- Reciprocal: JusticeHub provides infrastructure, communities provide knowledge, both benefit

**Output:**
- Policy recommendations co-developed with communities
- Evidence package for youth justice reform legislation
- Framework for how community platforms can inform policy

### Lever 2: Where the Resources Go
**How:**
- Revenue-sharing model redistributes value from community knowledge back to storytellers
- Research demonstrates cost-effectiveness of community-based alternatives
- Fellowship tests: Do funders shift investment when community-generated evidence shows impact?

**Output:**
- Economic model for community knowledge platforms
- Cost-benefit analysis of detention vs community support (community-verified)
- Recommendations for funding mechanisms that center community agency

### Lever 3: Hearts & Minds
**How:**
- Contained shifts hearts through embodied experience of detention alternatives
- JusticeHub shifts minds through accumulation of community narratives
- Fellowship researches: What combination of story + evidence + experience creates lasting change?

**Output:**
- Communication guide: "How to Shift Public Discourse from Punishment to Support"
- Media engagement strategy based on what worked
- Analysis of how narrative shifted (or didn't) during fellowship

## Compelling Narrative Framing

### The Story You're Telling

**Opening Hook:**
> "What if the communities most impacted by youth incarceration also held the solutions? What if we already have the evidence, but lack the infrastructure to make it count? What if story, technology, and art could work together to shift systems that have resisted change for generations?"

**The Problem (Hearts & Minds):**
> "We incarcerate young people at enormous cost ($2,355/day) with terrible outcomes (84% reoffend), while community-based programs achieve better results ($75/day, 3% reoffend) at a fraction of the cost. The evidence is clear. So why don't systems change?"

**The Missing Piece (Where Resources Go + Policies):**
> "Because communities lack the infrastructure to **translate lived experience into policy influence** and **economic participation in knowledge production**. Researchers study communities, policymakers talk about communities, but communities rarely lead the conversation."

**The Solution (Innovation):**
> "This fellowship tests whether **dual-mode engagement**—immersive art installations that shift hearts + digital storytelling platforms that shift policy—can create the conditions for communities to lead systems change. It asks: What happens when communities don't just tell their stories, but own the platforms that amplify them?"

**Why It Matters (Impact):**
> "If this works for youth justice, the methodology applies everywhere: homelessness, education, health. It demonstrates that investing in **community knowledge infrastructure** isn't just ethical—it's the most effective path to systems change."

**The Ask:**
> "This fellowship will research, document, and disseminate how to integrate physical and digital storytelling for systems change. It will create open-source playbooks so any community can replicate. And it will demonstrate that when communities own the infrastructure of knowledge production, they can shift the conditions that create disadvantage."

---

## Addressing Potential Concerns

### "Isn't this just service delivery + tech platform?"

**Response:**
NO. This is research into the **conditions** needed for systems change:
- Not delivering services, but researching how to shift systems that determine service delivery
- Not building a platform, but researching how platform ownership affects community agency
- Not creating an installation, but researching how physical + digital integration shifts policy

**The Research Questions Are:**
1. How do different knowledge systems (lived experience, creative practice, AI-assisted analysis, evidence) work together for systems change?
2. Does community ownership of digital infrastructure shift power dynamics in policy influence?
3. What combination of immersive experience and ongoing digital engagement creates lasting hearts & minds change?
4. How can economic participation in storytelling enable community self-determination?

### "Is this too broad? Too many moving parts?"

**Response:**
The integration IS the innovation:
- **Contained alone** = powerful experience, but temporary
- **JusticeHub alone** = useful platform, but lacks embodied connection
- **Together** = Test whether multi-modal creates deeper, more sustained systems change

**The fellowship researches the integration itself:**
- Does visiting Contained increase JusticeHub engagement?
- Do digital stories make people want physical experience?
- How do they work together to move hearts, minds, policy?

### "How is this different from other storytelling projects?"

**Response:**
Three key differences:

1. **Economic model:** Storytellers receive revenue share when their stories create value (unique in Australia)
2. **AI for community agency:** Using AI to accelerate story extraction, but communities control editing/approval (tests whether tech can serve decolonization)
3. **Systems change focus:** Not just raising awareness, but researching how storytelling infrastructure shifts policies, resources, and hearts/minds

### "Will communities actually participate?"

**Response:**
Already happening:
- Contained is designed to be hosted by communities (launching Oct 2025)
- JusticeHub has existing community partnerships
- Fellowship formalizes and researches what's already emerging organically

**Plus:**
- Communities are compensated for participation
- Research serves community goals (policy change) not just academic outputs
- Co-research model means communities shape the questions

## Conclusion: Why This Fellowship Will Succeed

This fellowship succeeds because it addresses PRF's core question:

> "How can we work differently to change the conditions that are contributing to these challenges?"

**The answer:**
By creating infrastructure that enables communities to lead systems change—not through charity or service delivery, but through **ownership of the platforms, stories, and evidence** that shift hearts, minds, policies, and resources.

**The innovation:**
Testing whether physical embodiment (Contained) + digital infrastructure (JusticeHub) + community ownership + economic participation creates conditions for transformational change.

**The impact:**
If successful, this fellowship demonstrates that the most effective path to breaking cycles of disadvantage is **investing in community knowledge infrastructure**—not studying communities, but resourcing them to lead their own systems change.

**The alignment:**
This fellowship embodies PRF's values (courage, curiosity, connection), principles (agency, relationships, reciprocity), and approach (systems change through multiple knowledge systems).

**The candidate:**
You bring the unique combination of technical expertise, creative practice, systems thinking, and community relationships needed to explore this pioneering idea with rigor, humility, and impact.

---

## Final Thought

PRF asks: "What possibilities on the next horizon are we not yet thinking about that we should be?"

**This fellowship's answer:**

> "We haven't yet imagined a world where communities own the digital and physical infrastructure of knowledge production—where the people most impacted by systems also control the platforms that shift them. This fellowship researches how to build that world."
