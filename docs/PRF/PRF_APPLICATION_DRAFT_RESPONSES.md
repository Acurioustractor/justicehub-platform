## Research Title

**Community-Led Systems Change: Integrating Physical Art Practice and Digital Storytelling Infrastructure to Transform Youth Justice in Australia**

*Alternative:*
**From Incarceration to Community: How Story, Technology, and Place Create Conditions for Systems Change**

---

## One-Sentence Summary

This fellowship researches how immersive art installations (Contained) and AI-assisted digital storytelling platforms (JusticeHub) can work together to create the conditions for communities to lead youth justice systems change—shifting hearts & minds, resource allocation, and policy from incarceration toward community-based support.

---

## Core Research Questions

1. **Integration:** How does combining physical immersive experience (Contained) with ongoing digital storytelling (JusticeHub) create conditions for systems change differently than either intervention alone?

2. **Community Ownership:** Does community ownership of digital storytelling infrastructure (including revenue-sharing for stories) shift power dynamics in policy influence and community agency?

3. **Knowledge Systems:** How can multiple knowledge systems—lived experience, Indigenous methodologies, creative art practice, AI-assisted analysis, and evidence—work together to inform transformational policy change?

4. **Evidence Translation:** What formats of evidence (embodied installation, digital narratives, statistical data, community testimony) reach which audiences, and how do they combine to shift hearts, minds, and policy?

## Question 1: Tell Us About Yourself (200 words)

*[Template - personalize with your story]*

I am a [your role/identity] who has spent [X years] working at the intersection of [technology/creative practice/community development/youth justice]. My journey began [personal connection to this work—why do you care?].

Through building JusticeHub, I learned that communities hold profound knowledge about systems change, but lack the infrastructure to translate lived experience into policy influence. Through developing Contained, I discovered that embodied experience shifts hearts and minds in ways that reports cannot. This fellowship emerges from asking: What happens when we combine both?

I bring [specific skills: technical expertise in AI/digital platforms, creative practice in installation design, systems thinking, community relationships]. But more importantly, I bring [personal qualities: humility to learn from communities, courage to challenge power dynamics, curiosity about what's possible when communities own the infrastructure of knowledge production].

I'm applying for this fellowship because [why now? what's at stake? what becomes possible?]. I want to research not just better programs, but the conditions needed for communities to lead their own systems change—with dignity, agency, and economic participation.

## Question 2: What Is Your Fellowship Idea? (500 words)

**The Problem**

Young people in Australia are incarcerated at enormous cost ($2,355/day in Queensland) with devastating outcomes: 84% reoffend, life paths disrupted, communities fragmented. Meanwhile, community-based alternatives achieve better outcomes ($75/day, 3% reoffend rate) at a fraction of the cost. The evidence is irrefutable—yet systems don't change. Why?

Because communities lack the infrastructure to translate lived experience into policy influence, and traditional research extracts knowledge from communities without redistributing power or resources. We study disadvantage, but communities experiencing it rarely lead the conversation about solutions.

**The Idea**

This fellowship researches how dual-mode engagement—combining physical immersive installations with digital storytelling platforms—can create the conditions for communities to lead systems change in youth justice.

**The Components:**

*Contained* is an immersive installation contrasting youth detention (Brisbane's 84% reoffend rate, $2,355/day) with community-based alternatives (Spain's Diagrama model: 73% success; CON|X platform: 3% reoffend, $75/day). The installation travels to communities, who "host the container and fill it with their solutions." It shifts hearts and minds through embodied experience of evidence.

*JusticeHub* is a digital platform enabling grassroots organizations to publish community stories with AI-assisted extraction from interview transcripts, ownership frameworks, and revenue-sharing when stories create value. It shifts policy and resource allocation by providing infrastructure for community knowledge production.

**The Integration Research:**

This fellowship tests whether these work better together:
- Does visiting Contained increase engagement with JusticeHub digital stories?
- Do digital narratives make people seek physical experience?
- How do embodied experience + ongoing digital engagement combine to shift hearts, minds, policy, and funding?

**The Methodology:**

Working **with** 5-10 communities hosting Contained, I will:

1. **Map the System (Months 1-3):** Establish baseline—track who visits installations, document initial JusticeHub engagement, map youth justice policy ecosystem

2. **Co-Research (Months 4-9):** Partner with communities to gather stories, test AI-assisted extraction (communities edit and approve), implement ownership/revenue-sharing, document how economic participation affects agency

3. **Test Systems Change (Months 10-12):** Present community-generated evidence to policymakers, track media discourse shifts, document funding allocation changes, analyze which evidence formats moved which audiences

4. **Synthesize & Disseminate (Months 13-18):** Create open-source playbooks so any community can replicate, publish findings on what creates conditions for systems change

**Why It Matters**

This research fills a critical gap: We know community-based programs work better than incarceration, but we don't know how to create conditions for systems to adopt them. This fellowship researches the "how"—not better programs, but better infrastructure for communities to lead change.

If successful, the methodology scales beyond youth justice to any systems change effort: homelessness, education, health. It demonstrates that investing in community knowledge infrastructure isn't just ethical—it's the most effective path to breaking cycles of disadvantage.

---

## Question 3: Why Is This Idea Important? (300 words)

This idea addresses a fundamental gap in how we approach systems change: we focus on programs, policies, OR narrative—rarely all three, and almost never with communities in the lead.

**Current Approaches Miss the Integration:**
- **Program evaluations** produce evidence but rarely shift hearts and minds
- **Awareness campaigns** change perception but don't redistribute resources
- **Policy advocacy** proposes solutions but lacks community ownership
- **Art installations** move emotions but don't sustain engagement
- **Digital platforms** create reach but lack embodied connection

**This Fellowship Asks: What If We Combined All Five?**

The importance lies in three pioneering areas:

**1. Community as Co-Researchers, Not Subjects**
Communities experiencing disadvantage become knowledge producers with infrastructure they own (economically and technically). This tests whether redistributing power in knowledge production creates different policy outcomes than traditional research.

**2. Multiple Knowledge Systems Integration**
Indigenous knowledge recognizes story as evidence. Creative practice recognizes embodied experience as knowledge. Technology recognizes pattern recognition as insight. This fellowship researches how these systems work together—not replacing academic research but expanding what counts as evidence.

**3. Scalable Methodology for Systems Change**
If physical + digital integration works for youth justice, it works everywhere. The fellowship produces open-source playbooks so any community can replicate, fundamentally shifting how Australia approaches systems change.

**What's at Stake:**

Without this research, we continue investing in programs while systems remain unchanged. We continue studying communities while they lack agency over their own narratives. We continue separating evidence, experience, and emotion when policy requires all three.

This fellowship demonstrates that the most effective path to systems change is investing in community knowledge infrastructure—not researching communities, but resourcing them to lead their own transformation.

---

## Question 4: How Does This Align With PRF's Strategic Outcomes? (300 words)

This fellowship directly advances all three PRF strategic outcomes through researching the conditions needed for community-led systems change:

**Primary: Children and Young People Have Positive Life Paths Free from Entrenched Poverty and Harm**

Youth incarceration IS entrenched harm: 84% reoffend, limited education, disrupted families, generational impact. Contained demonstrates community-based alternatives achieve better outcomes at lower cost. JusticeHub provides infrastructure for young people and families to share stories with dignity and economic participation. This fellowship researches how to create conditions for systems to shift from incarceration to community support—directly affecting thousands of young people's life paths.

**Secondary: Places and Communities Are Connected, Imagining and Leading Their Own Futures**

Both Contained and JusticeHub are designed for community ownership: communities host the installation and "fill it with their solutions"; communities control their stories and benefit economically when they create value. This fellowship researches whether infrastructure ownership enables communities to move from service recipients to systems change leaders—imagining and implementing their own futures.

**Tertiary: First Nations Peoples and Communities Are Self-Determining**

First Nations young people are vastly overrepresented in detention. This fellowship centers Indigenous knowledge systems (story as evidence, community as authority) and tests economic models (revenue-sharing, ownership frameworks) that support self-determination. It asks: Can digital/physical infrastructure enable First Nations communities to lead policy change on their own terms?

**Conditions Support Thriving:**

The fellowship researches the conditions themselves:
- **Hearts & minds:** How does embodied experience + digital narrative shift public and political will?
- **Where resources go:** Does community-generated evidence redirect funding from detention to community programs?
- **Policies & programs:** How do communities translate lived experience into policy influence?

This isn't research about thriving—it's research into the conditions that make thriving possible.

---

## Question 5: What Is Your Approach and Methodology? (500 words)

This fellowship uses participatory action research methodology, integrating community co-research, creative practice, digital ethnography, and systems analysis. Communities are not research subjects—they are co-researchers investigating systems change together.

*Physical Component:*
- Launch Contained in 3 initial communities (targeting areas with high youth detention rates)
- Document: visitor numbers, demographics, responses (surveys, interviews)
- Track: policy-maker attendance, media coverage, community reactions

*Digital Component:*
- Onboard 10 grassroots organizations to JusticeHub platform
- Train communities in AI-assisted story extraction process
- Establish ownership and revenue-sharing frameworks

*Integration Measurement:*
- Track: Do Contained visitors engage with JusticeHub?
- Monitor: Do digital story readers seek physical installation?
- Map: Youth justice policy ecosystem (decision-makers, funders, influencers)

**Phase 2: Deep Community Engagement (Months 4-9)**

*Co-Research with Communities:*
- Partner with 5 communities hosting Contained installations
- Conduct story-gathering workshops with young people, families, community workers
- Use JusticeHub AI to extract themes, quotes, case studies from interview transcripts

- Track which evidence formats reach which audiences (installation testimony vs digital articles vs statistics)
- Document barriers and enablers to policy influence

*Economic Modeling:*
- Implement revenue-sharing when stories are republished, cited, or used by media/researchers
- Track: Does economic participation affect community engagement? Trust? Agency?
- Document: How much value flows back to communities?

**Phase 3: Testing Systems Change Hypotheses (Months 10-12)**

*Policy Engagement:*
- Communities present findings to state/federal policymakers, youth justice departments, funding bodies
- Document: How do policymakers respond to community-led evidence vs traditional research?
- Track: What evidence formats influence what decisions?

*Hearts & Minds Analysis:*
- Measure media coverage, analyze public discourse, monitor social media sentiment
- Track narrative shift: from "tough on crime" to "community support"
- Document: What messaging/formats shifted perception?

*Resource Flow Tracking:*
- Monitor: Does evidence shift funding from detention to community programs?
- Document: Do organizations using JusticeHub gain new funding opportunities?
- Analyze: What evidence convinced funders to reallocate resources?

**Phase 4: Synthesis and Dissemination (Months 13-18)**

*Analysis (Months 13-15):*
- Synthesize findings across all research questions
- Identify: What conditions enabled systems change? What prevented it?
- Document: How did physical + digital integration work?
- Analyze: What role did community ownership play?

*Dissemination (Months 16-18):*
Create outputs for multiple audiences:
- **Communities:** Open-source "Host Contained + Build Your JusticeHub" playbook
- **Funders:** "Investing in Community Knowledge Infrastructure" guide

- **Sector:** "Beyond Storytelling: Digital Platforms as Sites of Self-Determination" methodology paper

*Engagement:*
- Present at youth justice conferences, systems change convenings
- Host community-led dissemination events
- Work with PRF to reach government networks

**Ethical Framework:**

All research follows principles of:
- **Community consent:** Communities choose what to share, when, how
- **Economic reciprocity:** Communities benefit financially when their knowledge creates value
- **Knowledge sovereignty:** Communities own their stories and data
- **Dual accountability:** Research serves community goals AND contributes to knowledge

## Key Talking Points for Interviews

*If you're shortlisted for interviews, these are core messages to emphasize:*

### On Innovation

**"This is pioneering because no one has tested physical + digital integration for systems change in this way."**

- Most research focuses on programs OR policy OR narrative
- We're testing whether combining immersive embodied experience with ongoing digital engagement creates deeper systems change
- The integration itself is the innovation—not just better programs, but better infrastructure for communities to lead

### On Community Partnership

**"This isn't research ON communities—it's research WITH communities who own the infrastructure."**

- Communities edit and approve all AI-extracted content
- Communities receive economic participation when stories create value
- Communities are co-researchers, not subjects
- Research serves community goals (policy change) not just academic outputs

### On Systems Change

**"We're not researching better programs—we're researching the conditions that enable communities to shift systems."**

- Addressing all three PRF levers: hearts & minds (Contained), where resources go (revenue-sharing), policies & programs (community-generated evidence)
- Focusing on infrastructure, not interventions
- If it works for youth justice, methodology scales to any systems change effort

### On Evidence

**"What if lived experience, creative practice, and data worked together—instead of competing?"**

- Indigenous knowledge recognizes story as evidence
- Creative practice recognizes embodied experience as knowledge
- Technology recognizes pattern detection as insight
- This fellowship researches how they integrate for policy influence

### On Timing

**"The evidence is clear, the timing is right, and communities are ready."**

- Youth justice reform is active policy area
- Contained launches October 2025
- JusticeHub has existing partnerships
- Community-led approaches gaining traction in policy spaces

### On Impact

**"Success means communities own the platforms that shift systems—not researchers, not policymakers, communities."**

- Immediate: Policy meetings, media coverage, funding shifts
- Long-term: Communities independently operate infrastructure
- Ultimate: System changes so young people experience different life paths

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Position This As:

**Service Delivery**
- "JusticeHub will provide storytelling services to communities"
- **Instead:** "JusticeHub provides infrastructure communities own to lead knowledge production"

**Technology Project**
- "We're building an AI platform"
- **Instead:** "We're researching how AI can serve community agency in systems change"

**Art Exhibition**
- "Contained is an installation that raises awareness"
- **Instead:** "Contained is research methodology testing how embodied experience shifts policy"

**Academic Research**
- "This will produce academic papers about disadvantage"
- **Instead:** "This researches conditions for systems change—findings serve communities first"

**Too Broad**
- "This will solve youth justice"
- **Instead:** "This researches specific conditions: how physical + digital integration shifts hearts/minds/policy"

### ✅ Do Emphasize:

- **Community agency** throughout
- **Systems change** not service delivery
- **Research questions** about conditions, not conclusions about programs
- **Integration** as the innovation
- **Scalability** beyond youth justice
- **Economic reciprocity** as both ethical and research question
- **Multiple knowledge systems** working together
- **PRF alignment** with values, principles, outcomes
