## TOTAL: $250,000

**Breakdown:**
- Project Work: $220,000 (88%)
- Personal Development: $30,000 (12%)

**Community Benefit:**
- $90,000 (36% of total) flows directly to/for communities
- $110,000 fellow time working WITH communities (not extracting FROM)

---

## KEY BUDGET PRINCIPLES (Add to Template Notes)

1. **Sized for research period:** 18 months prototyping, not full-scale implementation
2. **Community benefit first:** 41% of project budget ($90k of $220k) directly to/for communities
3. **Economic reciprocity:** Compensation is both ethics AND research question
4. **Depth over breadth:** Budget allows prioritizing 3-5 deep communities over maximum numbers
5. **Transparency:** Fellow accountable to communities, PRF, and sector

## BUDGET TALKING POINTS (For Interviews)

**If asked "Why so much fellow time?"**
"$110k over 18 months is ~70% FTE for rigorous co-research. This isn't transactional data collection—it's sustained community partnership requiring deep relationship building, participatory analysis, and ongoing accountability. Fellow serves as facilitator, not extractor."

**If asked "Why community compensation?"**
"Economic reciprocity is both ethical requirement AND core research question. We're testing whether compensation affects engagement quality, trust, agency, and sustainability. When community knowledge creates value, communities should benefit—challenging extractive research models."

**If asked "Why both Contained and JusticeHub?"**
"That's the research question: does physical embodied experience PLUS ongoing digital engagement create deeper systems change than either alone? We need both to test integration hypothesis. $70k total is sized for research period (5 communities, 18 months), not full-scale national rollout."

**If asked "Is this research or service delivery?"**
"Explicitly research. All infrastructure sized for prototyping period. We're testing WHETHER these approaches create conditions for systems change, and if so, HOW. JusticeHub and Contained are emerging prototypes—the fellowship asks: do they actually work?"

**If asked "What if you need to cut budget?"**
"We'd prioritize depth over breadth: 3 communities with deep engagement rather than 5 communities surface-level. Budget allows flexibility—the commitment is rigorous learning, not maximum numbers."

→ $40k Contained + $30k JusticeHub

✅ **Research Question 2** (ownership shifts power dynamics)
→ $20k compensation + $10k revenue-sharing + community-controlled platforms

✅ **Research Question 3** (multiple knowledge systems)
→ $10k Indigenous methodology training + mixed-methods data collection

✅ **Participatory Action Research Methodology**
→ $110k fellow time facilitating co-research

✅ **Community Benefit Priority**
→ $90k (36%) directly to/for communities

✅ **PRF Values** (Courage, Curiosity, Connection)
