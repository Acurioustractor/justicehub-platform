## ⭐ Questions 4 & 9: PERSONALIZED FOR YOU

### Question 4: Why Is This Important to You? (250 words)
**Location:** [PRF_Q4_PERSONALIZED.md](PRF_Q4_PERSONALIZED.md)

**Your authentic response based on your bio:**

This fellowship emerges from a journey that began in Bolivian prisons, where I witnessed resilience in the most unlikely places. As a prison visitor, then later facilitating offending programs for 300+ participants in Queensland Corrective Services, I saw that people trapped in systems often held the clearest vision of what needed to change. Yet their knowledge rarely shaped the systems themselves.

At Orange Sky, photographing people experiencing homelessness across Australia, I learned that every person has a story worth telling. But I also learned something harder: telling stories isn't enough if power remains unchanged. At AIME, working with Indigenous communities, I encountered 60,000 years of systems thinking that modern policy continues to ignore. Communities don't need us to solve their problems—they need infrastructure to implement their own solutions.

This fellowship matters because I've spent two decades working **in** systems—youth refuges, corrections, homelessness services, youth justice—and I've seen the pattern: we fund programs that work, then dismantle them when funding ends. We commission research that extracts community knowledge, then shelve reports. We celebrate individual success stories while systems remain unchanged.

The question that drives this work is fundamental: What if communities owned the platforms that tell their stories? What if grassroots workers supporting young people could translate their wisdom into policy influence? What if the infrastructure itself—digital, physical, economic—belonged to communities?

If this fellowship succeeds, we demonstrate that the path to systems change isn't better research **about** communities, but better infrastructure **for** communities to lead change themselves. That possibility—communities as architects, not subjects—is what keeps me working toward it.

### Question 9: Why You're a Great Candidate (500 words)
**Location:** [PRF_Q9_PERSONALIZED.md](PRF_Q9_PERSONALIZED.md)

**Your authentic response based on your bio:**

I bring two decades of experience working at the intersection of community knowledge and institutional systems, combined with the technical and creative skills to translate that understanding into infrastructure communities can own.

**Demonstrated Leadership Across Systems**

I've navigated every level of the systems this fellowship investigates: as a youth support worker and refuge coordinator (2004-2006), facilitating offending programs for 300+ participants at Queensland Corrective Services (2010-2014), documenting homelessness stories as Brand and Communications Manager at Orange Sky (2016-2020), and integrating Indigenous systems thinking with digital platforms at AIME (2020-2023). I don't study these systems academically—I've worked within them, understanding both their potential and their failures.

From this foundation, I co-founded A Curious Tractor and built JusticeHub as a platform for grassroots organizations, and Contained as an immersive installation challenging youth detention approaches. These aren't proposals—they're working prototypes developed through deep community partnerships, launching October 2025.

**Technical and Creative Integration**

My technical expertise spans digital platform development, AI ethics, and participatory design. I understand technology not as neutral tool but as infrastructure that either serves community agency or extracts community value. At AIME, I helped develop IMAGI-NATION digital platform connecting marginalized youth with opportunities, learning how to build systems communities control.

My creative practice—honed through photography at Orange Sky and installation design for Contained—taught me that embodied experience shifts understanding differently than data. I know how physical spaces create connection that reports cannot.

This combination—technical depth and creative sensibility, digital infrastructure and physical installation—positions me uniquely to research their integration for systems change.

**Systems Thinking Grounded in Community Wisdom**

Working with Aboriginal communities at AIME fundamentally shifted my approach. I learned to listen before prescribing, recognizing that 60,000 years of Indigenous systems thinking offers frameworks modern policy ignores. This fellowship centers those methodologies—story as evidence, community as authority, sovereignty over knowledge—rather than treating them as consultation box-ticking.

I understand youth justice not as isolated programs but as ecosystem: policies, funding flows, public narratives, community responses. I've navigated between community, corrections, policy, nonprofit, creative, and technology sectors—speaking across silos while maintaining accountability to communities.

**Values Alignment with PRF**

**Courage:** I challenge power dynamics by proposing communities as co-researchers who own platforms and benefit economically through revenue-sharing. I've spent my career making institutions uncomfortable by centering community authority.

**Curiosity:** I genuinely don't know how physical and digital integration works for systems change—that's why this is research. I'm driven to understand how different knowledge systems can inform policy together, not compete.

**Connection:** Every project I've built—from Positive Futures Program in corrections to IMAGI-NATION digital platform to JusticeHub—emerged from relationships with communities, not solo ideation. My work is fundamentally collaborative.

**Why Now**

After twenty years working in systems, I've reached a clarity: we don't need better programs delivered to communities; we need better infrastructure owned by communities. JusticeHub and Contained prove I can build that infrastructure. This fellowship enables rigorous research into whether it actually shifts the conditions—hearts, minds, policies, resources—that determine young people's life paths.

I'm ready because communities are ready. Contained launches October 2025. Youth justice reform is active policy conversation. The evidence about community-based alternatives is irrefutable. What's missing is research documenting the conditions that enable communities to lead systems change themselves.

This fellowship researches exactly that—with me as facilitator, communities as architects.

## 🎯 Why This Application Will Stand Out

### 1. Authentic Personal Story
Your Q4 and Q9 aren't generic—they're YOUR journey from Bolivia prisons → QCS → Orange Sky → AIME → building JusticeHub and Contained. That arc is unique.

### 2. Working Prototypes
You're not proposing ideas—you've already built JusticeHub and Contained. You're proposing to rigorously research whether they create systems change conditions. That's rare.

### 3. Perfect Timing
Contained launches October 2025, right when fellowship begins March 2026. This isn't hypothetical future work—it's researching something actually happening.

### 4. Unique Skill Combination
Most applicants have community experience OR technical skills OR creative practice. You have all three, evidenced by 20-year career arc.

### 5. Complete PRF Alignment
- **All three outcomes:** Children/young people + Places/communities + First Nations ✓
- **All three values:** Courage + Curiosity + Connection ✓
- **All three principles:** Agency + Relationships + Reciprocity ✓
- **All three levers:** Policies + Resources + Hearts/minds ✓

### 6. Community-Centered Throughout
Not research ON communities, WITH communities as co-researchers who own infrastructure and benefit economically.

### 7. Indigenous Methodologies Already Integrated
You learned at AIME, not learning now—shows respect and existing relationships.

## 🎓 What Makes Your Application Exceptional

### The Narrative Arc

**Problem:** Systems harm young people despite evidence of better alternatives

**Your Journey:** 20 years working in systems, witnessing pattern—programs work, systems don't change

**Your Insight:** Missing piece is community ownership of infrastructure, not better programs

**Your Evidence:** You've built working prototypes (JusticeHub, Contained)

**Your Proposal:** Research whether these create conditions for community-led systems change

**Your Qualifications:** Unique combination of community relationships, technical skills, creative practice, systems experience

**The Impact:** Demonstrate that communities don't need better advocates—they need owned infrastructure
