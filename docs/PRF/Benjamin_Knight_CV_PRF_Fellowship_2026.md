## CURRENT WORK

### Co-founder | A Curious Tractor
**September 2023 - Present | Witta, Queensland**

Founded impact organization working toward "a just, equitable, and regenerative world where every person and community can thrive" through global justice innovation, storytelling, nature-based learning, and transformative art.

**Key Projects & Achievements:**

**Youth Justice (YJ:Your Justice) Initiative**
- Leading flagship project amplifying voices of workers supporting justice-involved youth across Queensland, Northern Territory, and nationally
- Built sustained relationships with Indigenous community-owned organizations in Mount Isa (Kalkadoon Country), Alice Springs, North Stradbroke Island, Palm Island, and Brisbane through visiting, listening, and collaborative storytelling
- Documented community-led alternatives to youth detention, highlighting that Indigenous youth face detention rates up to 22 times higher than non-Indigenous youth in Qld/NT
- Identified critical gap: communities hold profound solutions but lack owned infrastructure to translate knowledge into policy influence

**JusticeHub Digital Platform (Launching October 2025)**
- Designed and developing digital storytelling platform enabling grassroots organizations to publish community narratives with full ownership frameworks and revenue-sharing mechanisms
- Platform uses AI-assisted extraction from interview transcripts with critical ethical safeguard: communities review, edit, and approve all content before publication
- Pioneering economic participation model: when stories create value (republished, cited, influence funding), communities receive direct financial benefit
- Addresses fundamental power imbalance: researchers traditionally extract community knowledge while communities receive no ongoing benefit

**Contained Immersive Installation (Launching October 2025)**
- Created immersive art installation contrasting youth detention outcomes ($2,355/day, 84% reoffend) with community-based alternatives ($75/day, 3% reoffend)
- Designed for community hosting and facilitation: "30 minutes. Three rooms. One truth about youth justice."
- Installation approach: communities "fill it with their solutions" rather than researcher-imposed narratives
- Combines embodied experience with digital engagement (QR codes linking to JusticeHub stories) to test whether physical + digital integration creates deeper systems change

**Story Editor, JusticeHub Blog**
- Authored 35+ articles (July 2024 - July 2025) covering youth justice reform, community transformation, and systems analysis
- Key articles include:
  - International comparisons: Spain's Diagrama model, European youth detention approaches
  - Community spotlights: CAMPFIRE, DeadlyLabs, ConFit Pathways, Justice Reinvestment networks
  - Policy analysis: Queensland government spending, Making Queensland Safer Bill submissions
  - Philosophical frameworks: Plato's Cave reimagined for youth justice, entropy and systems change
  - Indigenous knowledge: Mount Isa NAIDOC Week, cultural authority, two-worlds navigation
- Established reputation as thought leader synthesizing international evidence, Indigenous methodologies, and community wisdom

**The Confessional Project**
- Developed "safe space for truth and vulnerability" initiative using storytelling to shift perspectives toward vulnerable populations
- Applied narrative methodology centering lived experience as authoritative knowledge

**Organizational Approach:**
- Global justice innovation combining storytelling, nature-based wisdom, and transformative art
- Partnerships rooted in lived experiences and aspirations of people most directly impacted
- Four pillars: Justice Innovation | Storytelling for Impact | Nature for Nurture | Art for Conceptualization

**Skills Applied:** Community partnership development, participatory action research, digital platform architecture, AI ethics, immersive installation design, policy analysis, Indigenous methodologies, visual storytelling, systems thinking

## PROFESSIONAL VALUES & APPROACH

**Empathy**
"Understanding and sharing the feelings of others is the cornerstone of my work, guiding my interactions and decisions." Every project begins with deep listening to lived experience.

**Innovation**
Creative solutions to complex challenges, blending cutting-edge approaches (AI, digital platforms, immersive art) with unconventional methods (community ownership, revenue-sharing, Indigenous knowledge systems). Innovation must serve community agency, not extract from it.

**Resilience**
The capacity to adapt, overcome adversity, and emerge stronger—essential for both individuals and communities. Recognizing that resilience often manifests in unexpected places when structural support is absent.

**Courage**
Challenging power dynamics by centering community authority and economic participation in knowledge production. Making institutions uncomfortable by insisting communities own platforms and benefit when their stories create value.

**Curiosity**
Committed to genuine research with open questions, not validating predetermined assumptions. "I genuinely don't know if physical and digital integration works for systems change—that's why this is research."

**Connection**
Every project emerges from relationships with communities, not solo ideation. Long-term partnerships over transactional research. Accountability to communities, not just funders or institutions.

**Reciprocity**
Economic participation, knowledge ownership, and mutual accountability in all partnerships. When community knowledge creates value, communities must benefit.

**Humility**
Learning from communities, especially 60,000+ years of Indigenous knowledge systems, recognizing they hold solutions. "My most important task was to listen—to keep my mouth shut and open my mind and heart."

## PERSONAL JOURNEY & GROWTH

**Raised:** Muswellbrook, NSW - "vibrant yet challenging" community that shaped understanding of structural disadvantage and community resilience

**Self-Reflection:** Self-described as imperfect student who "wasn't always ideal" - views failures and setbacks as learning opportunities and growth catalysts

**Authenticity:** Committed to authenticity over social status or "cool factor" - witnessed through contrast experiences like Kanye West concert that clarified preference for genuine connection

**Philosophy:** 20-year arc from Bolivia prisons → QCS → Orange Sky → AIME → A Curious Tractor represents consistent evolution: witnessing resilience → learning storytelling isn't enough → discovering Indigenous methodologies → building owned infrastructure → researching conditions for community-led systems change

**Current Clarity:** "We don't need better programs delivered to communities; we need better infrastructure owned by communities."

**This CV demonstrates 20 years of consistent evolution:** From witnessing resilience in Bolivian prisons → facilitating programs for 300+ people in QCS → documenting homelessness dignity at Orange Sky → learning Indigenous methodologies at AIME → building community-owned infrastructure at A Curious Tractor.

**Unique combination of skills rarely found in single individual:** Technical (digital platforms, AI ethics, data analysis) + Creative (photography, installation design, documentary film) + Community (20 years direct service, Indigenous partnerships) + Systems (corrections, youth justice, homelessness, policy analysis).

**Ready for PRF Fellowship:** Contained and JusticeHub launching October 2025. Communities ready. Indigenous methodologies already integrated. Research questions genuinely open. Infrastructure built. Relationships established. Timing perfect.

**The question this career asks:** What are the CONDITIONS that enable communities to lead systems change themselves?

**This fellowship researches exactly that—with me as facilitator, communities as architects.**
