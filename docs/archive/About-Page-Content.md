# About JusticeHub

## Transforming Youth Justice Through Story, Technology, and Community

JusticeHub is more than a platform‚Äîit's a movement. We believe that young people are the experts on their own experiences, that communities hold the solutions to youth crime, and that technology should amplify voices rather than silence them.

## Our Story

Born from the recognition that Australia's youth justice system fails both young people and communities, JusticeHub emerged from conversations with young people who had navigated the system, the grassroots organizations supporting them, and communities seeking real solutions to youth crime.

**The reality we set out to change:**
- 70% of young people in detention reoffend within two years
- Communities spend $1,500+ per day on detention with poor outcomes  
- Young people's voices are absent from decisions about services meant to help them
- Grassroots organizations doing incredible work lack resources and recognition
- Families and communities have no visibility into whether their investments in youth programs actually work

- **Control their privacy** with granular consent management
- **Influence services** by sharing what actually helps and what doesn't

### üìä **Empathy Ledger** - Transparency That Transforms
Our breakthrough impact tracking system provides real-time visibility into:
- **Program effectiveness** across all funded initiatives
- **Cost comparisons** between detention and community programs
- **Young people's outcomes** in education, employment, housing, and wellbeing
