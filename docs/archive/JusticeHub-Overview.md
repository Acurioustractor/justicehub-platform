# JusticeHub: Digital Platform for Youth Justice Reform

## Overview

JusticeHub is a comprehensive digital platform that transforms how grassroots organizations support young people in the justice system. Built on evidence-based solutions, JusticeHub connects youth with proven community programs while providing transparency into the systemic issues and funding flows that perpetuate youth incarceration.

## The Problem We're Solving

### The Crisis
- **24x higher incarceration rate** for Indigenous young people compared to non-Indigenous youth
- **84.5% recidivism rate** for youth detention - a system that fails 8 out of 10 young people
- **$1.1 million per child annually** spent on detention that makes things worse
- Proven community solutions exist but remain invisible, underfunded, and disconnected

### The Evidence
Community-based programs consistently outperform detention:
- **78% average success rate** for community programs vs 15.5% for detention
- **$58,000 per child annually** for community programs vs $1.1M for detention
- **19x more cost-effective** with dramatically better outcomes for young people
