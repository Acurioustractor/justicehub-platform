## Files Generated

### SQL Import File
**Location**: `/supabase/generated-import.sql`
**Size**: 443 lines
**Contains**:

- PL/pgSQL procedure to auto-create services
- Category auto-assignment logic
- Verification queries

### Generator Script
**Location**: `/scripts/generate-import-sql.js`
**Purpose**: Converts Airtable CSV to SQL
**Usage**: `node scripts/generate-import-sql.js > supabase/generated-import.sql`

### Source Data
**Location**: `/Grid view.csv`
**Rows**: 336 organizations
**Unique**: 325 (after deduplication)

## Expected Results

### Before Import
- Organizations: ~26
- Services: 34

### After Import
- Organizations: **~351** (+325)
- Services: **~359** (+325)

### Service Category Distribution (Estimated)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Row-level security policy" errors
**Solution**: Use SQL Editor method (bypasses RLS)

### Issue: Duplicate organizations
**Solution**: SQL includes `ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING` - safe to rerun

### Issue: Services not created
**Solution**: Run the service creation PL/pgSQL block separately

### Issue: Wrong categories assigned
**Solution**: Update category mapping logic in generated SQL and rerun

## Verification Queries

After import, run these to verify:

```sql
-- Check total counts
SELECT
  'Organizations' as type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM organizations
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'Services' as type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM services;

-- Check category distribution
SELECT
  unnest(categories) as category,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM services
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Check organizations without services
SELECT name
FROM organizations
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT organization_id FROM services);

-- Check most recent imports
SELECT name, created_at
FROM organizations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
