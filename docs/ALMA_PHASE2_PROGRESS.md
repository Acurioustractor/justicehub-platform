## Lessons Learned

### **What Worked Well**
1. **Targeting known organizations**: Programs like AADS, VACCHO, ABCN were in database
2. **AIHW as source**: Youth Justice reports provide reliable outcome data
3. **Aboriginal health focus**: Health services have strong community monitoring
4. **Multi-agency programs**: Well-documented outcomes (5-Partners, ART)

### **Challenges**
1. **Program name matching**: 14 programs not found (may exist under different names)
2. **QLD CSV programs**: Many programs lack outcomes data in source material
3. **Generic program names**: Harder to find specific outcomes for broadly-named programs
4. **Evaluation gaps**: Many programs lack formal evaluation

### **Improvements for Next Batch**
1. **Check database first**: Query existing programs before creating enrichment script
2. **Flexible name matching**: Search for partial names or alternative spellings
3. **Multiple sources per program**: Cross-reference AIHW, government, and academic sources
4. **Document source quality**: Note evaluation rigor for each program
