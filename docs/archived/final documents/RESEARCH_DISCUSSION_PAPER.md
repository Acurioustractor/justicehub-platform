## 1. THE EVIDENCE BASE: Why JusticeHub is Needed {#the-evidence-base}

### 1.1 The Crisis: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Young People

**Key Statistic: 17x Overrepresentation**

**Source:** Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2024), *Youth justice in Australia 2022–23* (Table S16b)

**Full Citation:**
> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 10–17 year olds were 17 times as likely as non-Indigenous young people to be in detention on an average night in 2022–23.

**Additional Context:**
- In 2022–23, on an average night, **577 young people were in detention** across Australia
- Of these, **68% were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people**
- This represents a **slight increase from 67% in 2021–22**
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people make up only **6% of the 10-17 year old population**

**State-by-State Breakdown (2022-23):**

| State/Territory | % Indigenous in detention | % Indigenous in population | Overrepresentation rate |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Northern Territory | 94% | 43% | 2.2x |
| Western Australia | 74% | 8% | 9.3x |
| Queensland | 67% | 10% | 6.7x |
| South Australia | 55% | 5% | 11x |
| New South Wales | 60% | 6% | 10x |
| Victoria | 38% | 2% | 19x |
| Tasmania | 25% | 6% | 4.2x |
| ACT | 45% | 3% | 15x |

**Trend Analysis:**
- Overrepresentation has **increased** from 16x in 2018–19 to 17x in 2022–23
- Despite policy commitments to Close the Gap targets
- Number of Indigenous young people in detention has remained stable while non-Indigenous numbers decreased

### 1.2 Cost of Incarceration vs Prevention

**Key Statistic: $1,500+ per day detention cost**

**Source:** Productivity Commission (2024), *Report on Government Services*, Chapter 17 (Table 17A.22)

**Full Citation:**
> The average daily cost per young person in detention exceeded $1,500 in 2022–23 across Australian jurisdictions.

**Comparative Costs:**

| Intervention Type | Cost per young person per day | Annual cost (365 days) | Evidence of effectiveness |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Youth Detention** | $1,500+ | $547,500+ | **High recidivism** (50-70% re-offend within 2 years) |
| **Community-based programs** | $80-150 | $29,200-54,750 | **Moderate evidence** (30-40% reduction in re-offending) |
| **Cultural healing programs** | $120-200 | $43,800-73,000 | **Strong evidence** (40-60% reduction where culturally appropriate) |
| **Early intervention (0-5)** | $50-100 | $18,250-36,500 | **Best evidence** (prevention, not response) |

**Return on Investment:**
- **Every $1 invested in early intervention** saves **$7-13 in detention costs** over lifetime
- Cultural healing programs show **2.5x better outcomes** than mainstream youth justice programs for Indigenous young people
- **Justice reinvestment** in communities like Bourke shows **30-40% reduction in youth offending** within 3 years

**📊 TO ADD:**
- [ ] Detailed cost-benefit analysis of specific programs
- [ ] Longitudinal tracking data from Bourke justice reinvestment
- [ ] International comparison of youth justice costs

### 1.3 Information Fragmentation: The Hidden Cost

**Key Statistic: 30-40% time on unsuccessful grants**

**Estimated Source:** Sector practice observation and interviews (formal academic citation pending)

**Research Basis:**
While formal academic studies specifically measuring grant-writing time in the Australian youth justice sector are limited, this estimate is based on:

1. **Philanthropic Sector Research:**
   - Study by Philanthropy Australia (2019) found organizations spend average **25-35% of staff time on grant applications**
   - Success rate for competitive grants: **15-25%**
   - This means 75-85% of grant-writing time is "unsuccessful"

2. **Community Organization Interviews:**
   - A Curious Tractor interviews with 12 youth justice organizations (2023-2024)
   - Organizations reported spending **2-3 days per week** on grant applications
   - Average of **8-12 applications per quarter**, 2-3 successful
   - Senior staff time valued at $120-150K annually, 30-40% = **$36-60K per organization lost annually**

3. **Government Reports:**
   - Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) report (2021): "The grants treadmill"
   - Found community organizations spend **30-45% of time seeking funding**
   - 65% reported this as "major barrier to service delivery"

**Sector-Wide Cost:**
- Estimated **500+ organizations** working in youth justice in Australia
- If each spends **$36-60K annually** on unsuccessful grant applications
- Total sector cost: **$18-30M annually wasted on unsuccessful applications**
- This represents **funding that never reaches young people or communities**

**📊 TO ADD:**
- [ ] Commission formal academic study on grant-writing time in youth justice sector
- [ ] Survey 50+ organizations on grant application practices
- [ ] Longitudinal tracking of grant success rates and time investment

### 1.4 Knowledge Extraction Without Compensation

**The Pattern:**

**EXAMPLE 1: Academic Research Extraction**
- Researcher visits community to study "successful youth program"
- Community members spend **20-40 hours in interviews, focus groups**
- Program documentation shared, cultural knowledge explained
- Researcher publishes paper, gets academic credit, career advancement
- Community receives: **Thank you card + $200 gift card**
- Research findings locked behind paywalls or in academic journals community can't access

**EXAMPLE 2: Government Policy Development**
- Government consultation on new youth justice policy
- Community leaders invited to "consultation sessions"
- 3-5 full days of meetings sharing knowledge and experience
- Community members: **No payment** or **token $500 "sitting fee"** for week's work
- Consultant writing report: **$150K contract**
- Final policy: Community recommendations ignored or watered down

**EXAMPLE 3: International Delegations**
- International researchers/practitioners want to "learn from Australian Indigenous programs"
- Community hosts visits, cultural tours, program explanations
- Elders and practitioners spend **days sharing knowledge**
- Visitors return home, publish findings, speak at conferences, build careers
- Community receives: **Nothing** or **token koori gift**
- No ongoing relationship, no citation, no recognition

**The Economic Reality:**

| What Community Provides | Market Value (Consultant Rates) | What Community Usually Receives | Exploitation Gap |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| Elder knowledge (1 day) | $1,000-1,500 | $0-100 gift card | 90-100% |
| Program documentation | $5,000-10,000 (if consultant hired) | $0 | 100% |
| Cultural protocols consultation | $2,000-3,000 per day | $0-200 | 90-100% |
| Research participation (multi-day) | $8,000-15,000 (if paid as consultants) | $200-1,000 | 85-95% |

**JusticeHub's Alternative:**
- Community knowledge holders: **$1,000 per session** (consultant rates)
- Organization infrastructure: **$50K annually** (coordination capacity)
- Cultural protocols: **$15K annually** (proper Elder consultation)
- **Total per community: $180K annually in BASE scenario**

**This isn't generosity. It's fair compensation for intellectual property and cultural intelligence.**

**📊 TO ADD:**
- [ ] Survey of Indigenous organizations on knowledge extraction experiences
- [ ] Academic literature review on research ethics and Indigenous communities
- [ ] Case studies of knowledge extraction vs fair compensation models
- [ ] Cost analysis of cultural intelligence as intellectual property

### 3.2 Oonchiumpa Consultancy: Cultural Camps Model

**Location:** Alice Springs & Arrernte Country, Northern Territory
**Director:** Kristy Bloomfield (Chair of Lhere Artepe board)
**Model:** Culturally-led diversion through on-Country immersion
**Youth Served:** 18-50 at-risk young people annually

**The Approach:**

**Oonchiumpa ("Together" in Arrernte language) operates therapeutic cultural camps as alternative to detention or mainstream programs.**

**Program Components:**
1. **Bush Camps (7-14 days)**
   - Traditional lands, away from town stressors
   - Elder guidance, cultural immersion
   - Hunting, gathering, traditional practices
   - Ceremony and storytelling

2. **Cultural Activities**
   - Arrernte Boxing (traditional conflict resolution through sport)
   - Bush tucker gathering and cooking
   - Rock art interpretation and creation
   - Traditional tool-making

3. **Life Skills Development**
   - Education in cultural context
   - Employment pathways
   - Health and wellbeing
   - Connection to Country

4. **Family Involvement**
   - Family camps alongside youth camps
   - Cultural strengthening for whole families
   - Intergenerational knowledge transfer
   - Healing family relationships

**Evidence of Effectiveness:**

| Metric | Before Camp | After Camp (6 months) | Change | Source |
|--------|------------|----------------------|--------|---------|
| School attendance | 43% | 76% | **+77%** | NT Education Dept (2023) |
| Police contact | 4.2 incidents/youth/year | 1.1 incidents/youth/year | **-74%** | NT Police data (2023) |
| Cultural connection score | 3.1/10 | 8.4/10 | **+171%** | Oonchiumpa self-assessment |
| Family relationship quality | 4.5/10 | 7.8/10 | **+73%** | Participant surveys |
| Mental health & wellbeing | 4.2/10 | 7.1/10 | **+69%** | Modified SEWB assessment |

**Cost Comparison:**
- **Don Dale Youth Detention:** $1,800 per day
- **Mainstream youth program:** $200-300 per day
- **Oonchiumpa camp:** $280 per day (7-14 day program)
- **Long-term outcome value:** Estimated $15,000 per young person in reduced detention costs over 2 years

**Kristy Bloomfield's Vision:**

*"After consulting with at-risk young people and families, a lack of cultural brokerage provided by Aboriginal people became evident. We needed programs designed by us, run by us, on our Country. Not white fellas coming in telling us what to do."*

**Success Factors:**
1. **On-Country delivery:** Connection to traditional lands is healing
2. **Elder leadership:** Arrernte Elders central to program design and delivery
3. **Cultural authority:** Traditional owners, not external "experts"
4. **Holistic approach:** Not just the young person - whole family, whole community
5. **Flexibility:** Programs adapt to each young person, not rigid protocols

**Challenges:**
- **Funding insecurity:** Grant-dependent, no core funding
- **Scale limitations:** Can only serve 18-50 youth/year with current resources
- **Knowledge extraction:** Researchers, policymakers, international visitors come to learn - Oonchiumpa rarely compensated
- **Invisibility:** Success in Alice Springs, but model unknown nationally

### 3.4 Mounty Yarns: Youth-Led Storytelling & Advocacy

**Location:** Mount Druitt, Western Sydney, NSW
**Partnership:** Just Reinvest NSW
**Type:** Youth-led advocacy and storytelling program
**Focus:** Aboriginal young people with lived experience of justice system

**The Innovation:**

**Mounty Yarns is different: Young people are NOT subjects of research. They are PRODUCERS of knowledge.**

**Program Components:**
1. **Documentary Filmmaking**
   - Young people trained in video production
   - They film their own stories, their way
   - They control editing, final cut, distribution
   - They own the content

2. **Advocacy Training**
   - Public speaking skills
   - Policy understanding
   - Media engagement
   - Community organizing

3. **Policy Influence**
   - Young people present directly to government
   - TEDxSydney presentation by youth leader
   - Submissions to inquiries and reviews
   - Community education

4. **Peer Support**
   - Youth-led OzTag program
   - Learner driver mentor program
   - Creating safer communities
   - Positive alternatives to justice involvement

**Documentary Findings:**

**From the young people's own voices:**
- *"Growing up in Mount Druitt, you're automatically seen as a criminal"*
- *"Police drive past, they don't see a kid, they see a threat"*
- *"We don't need more programs. We need to be heard."*
- *"They do all this research on us, but never listen to us"*

**Impact:**
- **Screenings:** Documentary shown at community events, TEDxSydney, government forums
- **Reach:** Estimated 5,000+ people directly engaged
- **Policy influence:** Informed NSW Youth Justice Review recommendations
- **Community change:** Government and services gained "deeper understanding of lived experiences"
- **Youth empowerment:** Participants report increased confidence, agency, hope

**Evidence of Model:**

| Traditional Youth Justice Consultation | Mounty Yarns Model | Difference |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Adults research young people | Young people research themselves | **Youth as experts, not subjects** |
| Young people as data sources | Young people as knowledge producers | **Agency and ownership** |
| Researchers own IP | Young people own IP | **Knowledge sovereignty** |
| Tokenistic "youth voice" | Genuine youth leadership | **Real power shift** |
| One-off consultation | Ongoing advocacy program | **Sustained engagement** |

**Cost-Effectiveness:**
- **Program cost:** ~$80K annually
- **Traditional government consultation:** $150-300K for similar engagement
- **Value created:** Young people's documentary worth $200K+ if commissioned commercially
- **ROI:** Youth-led programs show **60-75% better engagement** than adult-designed programs

**Lessons for JusticeHub:**
- ✅ **Youth voice essential** (not just adult "experts" talking about young people)
- ✅ **Knowledge sovereignty for young people** (they own their stories)
- ✅ **Media/storytelling powerful** for systems change
- ✅ **Policy influence possible** with right platform
- ✅ **Cost-effective** compared to traditional consultations

**How JusticeHub Supports Mounty Yarns:**

- ✅ **Compensation** ($180K annually) for youth-led knowledge production
- ✅ **Connection to other youth-led programs** nationally and internationally
- ✅ **Training opportunities** for young people in platform management
- ✅ **Revenue pathway** from licensing content, delivering training

**Challenges:**
- **Sustainability:** Currently grant-dependent
- **Youth turnover:** Young people grow up, move on - need succession planning
- **Burn-out risk:** Heavy emotional toll on young people reliving trauma
- **Exploitation risk:** Media wanting to use their stories without compensation

**JusticeHub Protection:**
- ✅ Youth-friendly consent processes
- ✅ Mental health support built in
- ✅ Fair compensation for content use
- ✅ Youth retain veto rights over how stories are used
