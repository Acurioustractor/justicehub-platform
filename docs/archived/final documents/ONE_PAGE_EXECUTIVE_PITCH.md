# JusticeHub: One-Page Executive Pitch
## Community-Owned Intelligence Platform for Youth Justice Transformation

**Prepared for:** Mindaroo Foundation | **Date:** January 2025 | **Ask:** $10.5M over 3 years (BASE Scenario)

---

## 🎯 THE 60-SECOND PITCH

**Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are 17 times more likely to be in detention.** JusticeHub is a sector-wide digital intelligence platform—serving ALL young people—built under Indigenous leadership, owned by communities by Year 5, and generating its own revenue to break philanthropic dependency cycles.

**Not** another platform. **Building** community power through permanent infrastructure.

---

## 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

**The Problem:**
- Best-practice programs hidden in communities | Indigenous knowledge extracted without compensation
- Sector spends **30-40% of time writing unsuccessful grants** | Perpetual philanthropic dependency
- **521 programs already catalogued, 38+ stories captured** — platform operational, ready to scale

**The Opportunity:**
- Platform already built ($303K value created) | 6 confirmed community partners ready to engage
- Queensland invested $330M in justice programs | National Justice Reinvestment expanding
- International Indigenous communities seeking connection

---

## 🏗️ WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

### Platform Already Operational
✅ **521 programs** documented | ✅ **38+ stories** published | ✅ **450+ organizations** mapped | ✅ **Admin system** working | ✅ **$303K value** created

**Visit:** [justicehub-platform.vercel.app](https://justicehub-platform.vercel.app)

### This Budget Scales It
- **6 communities** deeply engaged with proper compensation ($180K annually each)
- **4 Indigenous developers** employed (Tech Lead eliminated by Year 3)
- **15-20 community members** trained in platform management, content creation
- **Community-owned ACCO** by Year 5 (not external control)
- **Revenue generation** pathway ($60K Year 3 → $400-600K by Year 7)

---

## 🎯 THE BASE SCENARIO (RECOMMENDED)

**$10.5M Over 3 Years** | **6 Communities** | **4 Indigenous Developers Employed**

| YEAR 1 ($3.1M) | YEAR 2 ($3.6M) | YEAR 3 ($3.8M) |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| • 6 communities: $540K (0.5 yr) | • 6 communities: **$1.08M** (full yr) | • 6 communities: **$1.08M** continues |
| • **2 trainees** learning ($36K each) | • **4 trainees** advancing ($36K each) | • **4 PAID DEVELOPERS** ($45K each) |
| • Tech Lead: 0.75 FTE ($112K) | • Tech Lead: 0.5 FTE ($75K) | • Tech Lead: **ELIMINATED ($0)** |
| • Platform BUILD ($500K) | • Platform ENHANCE ($270K) | • Platform MAINTAIN ($200K) |
| • Revenue: $0 (building) | • Revenue: $0 (proving value) | • **Revenue: $30-60K** |
| • 12 FTE team | • 12 FTE team + business dev | • **9 FTE team** (20% reduction) |

**Cost Reduction Evidence:** 20% staff savings by Year 3 through Indigenous capacity replacing external roles

---

## 💰 WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

### Not Just Another Grant
- **Seed capital for community ownership**, not ongoing program funding
- **Building permanent infrastructure**, not dependent services
- **Creating financial independence**, not creating new dependencies
- **Time-limited** with clear exit strategy (5 years to community ownership)

### Indigenous Knowledge Properly Valued
- **$1.08M annually** (22% of BASE budget) paid directly to communities
- **Consultant rates, not token stipends** ($1,000 per knowledge holder session)
- Communities control IP, consent, data, revenue

### Costs Reduce Over Time
| What Happens | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Indigenous developers trained | Tech Lead eliminated |
| Community content creators trained | External contractors reduced |
| Platform transitions to community | A Curious Tractor becomes service provider only |
| **Year 3 Evidence** | **20% staff cost reduction** |

### Revenue Pathway (Realistic Timeline)
- **Year 3:** $30-60K (memberships beginning, small training contracts)
- **Year 5:** $250-400K (35-50% self-sustaining)
- **Year 7:** $400-600K (50-70% self-sustaining)
- **Year 8+:** 75-85% self-sustaining (<$500K philanthropic need)

**Reality Check:** Social enterprises take 7-10 years to reach 50-70% self-sustaining. This timeline is honest.

## 🔄 THE SOVEREIGNTY FLYWHEEL

**Self-Reinforcing Cycle:**

```
① COMMUNITIES SHARE KNOWLEDGE ($80K partnership + sessions + bounties)
          ↓
② PLATFORM GROWS & IMPROVES (stories, programs, evidence)
          ↓
③ PRACTITIONERS USE PLATFORM (learning, connecting)
          ↓
④ REVENUE GENERATED (memberships, training)
          ↓
⑤ COMMUNITY INVESTMENT FUND (profits to communities)
          ↓
⑥ MORE COMMUNITIES JOIN (word spreads, trust builds)
          ↓
    (BACK TO STEP ①)
```

**Each cycle builds momentum. Each turn strengthens the next.**

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

**The Ask:** $10.5M over 3 years to scale a working platform, properly compensate 6 communities, employ 4 Indigenous developers, and build permanent sector infrastructure owned by communities.

**The Difference:** Not creating dependency. Building sovereignty. Not extracting knowledge. Valuing it. Not another project. Permanent infrastructure.

**The Opportunity:** Partner in proving that community ownership, economic self-determination, and Indigenous data sovereignty aren't just ideals — they're achievable, scalable, and transformational.

**We believe this is the right work, at the right time, with the right partners.**
