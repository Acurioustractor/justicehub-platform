## 🎯 Impact of Changes

### **What This Means for Mindaroo Pitch**

1. **Consistency Across Documents** ✅
   - All three strategic documents now cite the same budget range
   - Mindaroo will see consistent numbers whether they read the one-pager, full pitch, or budget doc

2. **Transparency & Values Alignment** ✅
   - Budget note explicitly states why costs are higher (fair compensation, not token engagement)
   - Demonstrates commitment to valuing Indigenous knowledge properly
   - Shows organizational sustainability (ACT overhead) rather than hidden costs

3. **Realistic Expectations** ✅
   - Higher budget reflects true cost of doing this work properly
   - No surprises or scope creep later
   - Foundation for trust-based relationship with Mindaroo

4. **Flexibility Maintained** ✅
   - Range ($9.5M - $13.0M) allows negotiation
   - BASE scenario ($10.5M) sits in the middle of the range
   - Can still pivot to LEAN ($5.9M) or UPPER ($17.6M) if needed

## 📋 Remaining Alignment Tasks (Low Priority)

From [SESSION_1_ALIGNMENT_FINDINGS.md](SESSION_1_ALIGNMENT_FINDINGS.md):

### **Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Clarify Indigenous developer progression (2 in Year 1 → 4 by Year 3)
- [ ] Add Year 5 sustainability target (60-70%) to STRATEGIC_PITCH and THREE_SCENARIOS
- [ ] Verify flywheel 6 steps are identical across all documents

### **Low Priority:**
- [ ] Standardize naming (Level 1/2/3 vs Minimal/Foundational/Comprehensive vs LEAN/BASE/UPPER)
- [ ] Enhance budget narrative explaining October 2025 revision

**Note:** These are refinements, not critical issues. The main budget alignment is now complete.

---

## ✅ Sign-Off

**Budget Alignment Status:** 🟢 **COMPLETE**

All critical budget discrepancies have been resolved. The MINDAROO_ONE_PAGER.md now accurately reflects the October 2025 budget revision and is fully aligned with the STRATEGIC_PITCH and THREE_SCENARIOS_BUDGET documents.

**Ready for:** Session 2 - Sovereignty Flywheel Creation in Figma
