# NSW Community Safety Investment Grant - Strategic Analysis
## Using JusticeHub Evidence to Question & Seize Opportunity

---

## Executive Summary

The NSW Government's Community Safety Investment Grant Program (Stream 2) represents both **a symptom of systemic failure** and **a genuine opportunity for transformation**—if we refuse to replicate the patterns that created the crisis.

**The Fundamental Tension:**
- NSW offers $100K-$300K for 2-year "community-led solutions" to youth justice
- Meanwhile, the evidence shows the system itself is the problem
- **BUT:** Strategic use of this funding could build infrastructure for community power that outlasts the grant

**This document provides:**
1. **Critical questions** the grant program fails to address
2. **Evidence-based challenges** to the program's assumptions
3. **Strategic opportunities** to use the funding for systems change
4. **A JusticeHub-informed approach** that builds community ownership, not dependency

---

## Part 1: QUESTIONING THE GRANT PROGRAM

### 🚨 What the Grant Reveals About the Problem

#### **1. The NSW Government Already Knows What Works—But Won't Fund It Properly**

**Evidence from JusticeHub Research:**
- **NSW Youth Koori Court evaluation (2022 BOCSAR):**
  - 40% reduction in custodial sentences
  - 84% less custody time at re-conviction
  - Average custody: 57 days → 25 days
  - Uses Elders and addresses underlying factors

**The Question:**
> If NSW's own evaluation shows Youth Koori Courts reduce custody by 84%, why are they funding *new experimental programs* instead of **scaling proven models**?

**What This Reveals:**
- Government prefers innovation theater over systemic change
- Easier to fund community organizations to "fix" youth than challenge police, courts, child protection
- Youth Koori Court threatens the status quo; community programs don't

---

#### **2. Two-Year Funding Perpetuates the Problem**

**Evidence from JusticeHub:**
- Queensland invested **$134M (2018-2023)** with minimal program effectiveness assessment
- **75% of QLD youth reoffend within 2 weeks** of release
- International models (Diagrama Spain, Missouri Model) show **10+ years needed** to build effective therapeutic systems

**The Question:**
> How can "community-led solutions" address intergenerational trauma, child protection pipelines, housing instability, education disengagement, and systemic racism in **24 months**?

**What This Reveals:**
- NSW wants communities to solve problems caused by 250+ years of colonization—in 2 years
- Short-term funding ensures communities remain dependent on government grants
- No pathway to sustainable community ownership or control

---

#### **3. "Community-Led" or Community-Used?**

**Evidence from JusticeHub:**
- **Lowitja Institute Review (2024):** Only 10 of 15 programs scored HIGH for cultural responsiveness
- Programs most effective when:
  - Indigenous-led (not just "partnerships")
  - Elders have genuine authority (not consultation tokens)
  - Place-based with connection to Country
  - Address ALL underlying factors (housing, family, education, health)

**The Question:**
> Does NSW define "community-led" as:
> - A) Aboriginal communities control governance, design, and delivery? OR
> - B) Non-Aboriginal organizations "partner" with Aboriginal consultants?

**What This Reveals:**
- Application explicitly allows **"non-Aboriginal organisations partnering with a lead ACCO"**
- This creates incentive for non-Aboriginal orgs to extract Aboriginal credibility
- True community control would mean **ACCO-only funding** with non-Aboriginal orgs as subordinate partners

---

#### **4. The Age of Criminal Responsibility Elephant**

**Evidence from JusticeHub:**
- **Scotland:** Age 12 criminal responsibility, therapeutic interventions for under-16s
- **Nordic countries:** Age 14-15, focus on welfare responses
- **International research:** Detention under age 14 causes more harm than it prevents

**The Question:**
> Why is NSW funding programs for 10-year-olds in the justice system instead of **raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14** like international best practice?

**What This Reveals:**
- NSW would rather pay communities to manage 10-year-olds in the justice system than challenge punitive laws
- Closes the Gap Target 11 is performative if children under 14 can still be criminalized

---

#### **5. Where's the Evidence Requirement?**

**Evidence from JusticeHub:**
- Queensland's **$134M investment** had "limited program effectiveness assessment"
- Only **13.6% recidivism** in evidence-based international models (Diagrama Spain)
- **75% reoffend in 2 weeks** in systems without rigorous evaluation

**The Question:**
> What evaluation framework will NSW use to assess these programs? And who owns the data?

**What This Reveals:**
- Grant guidelines mention "outcomes" but no rigorous evaluation methodology
- Communities will generate valuable data—but likely won't own or control it
- No mechanism to share learnings across communities (reinforces silos)

---

#### **6. The Funding Amount Tells the Story**

**Evidence from JusticeHub:**
- **Detention costs:** $1,500-$2,500 per young person per day
- **BackTrack Youth Works:** 87% employment transition, holistic support
- **Diagrama Spain:** Transform 40,000+ youth with therapeutic residential units
- **JusticeHub Mindaroo proposal:** $180K per community over 3 years for sustainable infrastructure

**The Math:**
- Detaining 1 young person for 1 year = **$547,500 - $912,500**
- This grant = **$100K-$300K for a 2-year program serving multiple youth**

**The Question:**
> If NSW can spend $500K-$900K/year to cage one child, why is a community program serving 10-50 youth only worth $50K-$150K/year?

**What This Reveals:**
- Punishment infrastructure gets billions; community solutions get crumbs
- NSW values incarceration 5-10x more than prevention
- "Investment" in community is rounding error compared to detention budgets

---

## Part 2: THE OPPORTUNITY—If We Refuse to Replicate

### 💡 How to Use This Grant for Systems Change (Not Just Service Delivery)

#### **Strategy 1: Build Community Intelligence Infrastructure, Not Just Programs**

**The Standard Approach (Don't Do This):**
- Apply for $300K to run mentoring program for 2 years
- Serve 30 young people, report good outcomes
- Grant ends, program folds, knowledge disappears
- Community has no assets, returns to dependency

**The JusticeHub Approach:**
- Use $300K to build **community-owned knowledge infrastructure**
- Deploy JusticeHub platform in local community (Bourke, Moree, Mount Isa, etc.)
- Train 4 Aboriginal staff (see Mindaroo compensation model: $180K over 3 years)
- Document what works/doesn't work for local context
- **After 2 years:** Community owns the data, the relationships, the evidence base
- **Sustainability:** Platform becomes regional hub for training, consulting, policy advocacy

**Why This Works:**
- Builds **permanent assets** in community, not temporary programs
- Generates **evidence** that can attract future funding
- Creates **Aboriginal employment** pathways (not just "participants")
- Challenges **extraction model** of government funding

---

#### **Strategy 2: Use Grant to Scale Proven Models NSW Already Endorsed**

**The Opportunity:**
- NSW's own BOCSAR evaluation proved Youth Koori Court works (40% custody reduction)
- Grant program mentions "innovative" and "new services"
- But also allows "enhancing existing service"

**The Play:**
- Partner with existing Youth Koori Court sites
- Use grant to build **community navigator** roles that connect young people to Koori Court
- Document **every barrier** that prevents referrals to Koori Court
- Use data to advocate for **mandatory diversion** to Koori Court
- After 2 years: You have evidence for policy change, not just service delivery

**Why This Threatens the System:**
- Exposes that NSW has the solution but won't mandate it
- Builds case for **legislative change**, not just program funding
- Creates community expertise to challenge judicial discretion

---

#### **Strategy 3: Connect 10-17 Justice to 0-5 Prevention (The Mindaroo Model)**

**The Opportunity:**
- Grant focuses on 10-17 age group
- But JusticeHub research shows **intergenerational trauma** and **child protection pipeline** as root causes
- Mindaroo pitch demonstrates **0-5 prevention connection**

**The Play:**
- Use grant to map **every young person's child protection history**
- Partner with early childhood services to track 0-5 siblings of justice-involved youth
- Document the **pipeline** from child removal → out-of-home care → youth justice
- Build evidence for **family preservation investment** that prevents justice involvement

**After 2 years:**
- You have longitudinal data showing child protection as predictor
- Evidence to demand **integrated funding** (child protection + youth justice + housing + education)
- Community owns the relationships across the continuum

**Why This Works:**
- Challenges **siloed government departments**
- Builds case for **justice reinvestment** (Bourke model: 46% DV reduction)
- Positions community as holder of truth about what causes justice involvement

---

#### **Strategy 4: Aboriginal Data Sovereignty + Collective Impact**

**The Opportunity:**
- Grant guidelines silent on data ownership
- JusticeHub has 454 organizations, 521 programs documented
- Mindaroo model includes **Empathy Ledger** for shared data infrastructure

**The Play:**
- Multiple communities apply for grants using JusticeHub framework
- All data collected goes into **community-controlled repository** (not NSW-owned databases)
- Communities share learnings across sites in real-time
- After 2 years: Aboriginal communities own the **national evidence base** on what works

**Why This Threatens the System:**
- Government can't control the narrative about "what works"
- Communities can benchmark NSW against international best practice
- Creates **collective power** instead of isolated programs competing for funding

---

#### **Strategy 5: Use Funding to Document System Failure (Not Just Youth "Problems")**

**The Standard Approach (Don't Do This):**
- Report on "at-risk youth" characteristics
- Count "positive outcomes" for individuals
- Reinforce narrative that **youth need fixing**

**The JusticeHub Approach:**
- Document **every system interaction** young people experience
- Track: Police encounters, child protection involvement, school suspensions, mental health denials, housing instability
- Show how **systems fail young people**, not how young people fail
- Use JusticeHub stories platform to center **young people's voices** about what they actually need

**After 2 years:**
- You have evidence for **structural racism** in NSW systems
- Data to challenge **police, courts, child protection, education**
- Young people positioned as **experts** on system reform, not "participants" in programs

---

## Part 3: THE JUXTAPOSITION—What NSW Could Fund vs. What It's Offering

### What $300K Could Actually Do (If NSW Was Serious)

| **What NSW Is Offering** | **What Evidence Says Would Work** |
|---|---|
| $300K for 2-year community program | $300K = 40-55 days of detention for 1 youth. Why not fund ALTERNATIVES TO DETENTION? |
| "Innovative" new programs | Scale proven Youth Koori Court model (40% custody reduction) |
| Non-Aboriginal orgs "partnering" with ACCOs | ACCO-only funding with real governance control |
| 2-year grants, no sustainability plan | 10-year investment in community infrastructure (Diagrama model) |
| Individual youth "outcomes" reporting | Systemic data on how government agencies fail young people |
| "Culturally responsive" consultation | Elders with decision-making authority, not advisory roles |
| Age 10+ criminal responsibility | Raise age to 14 (international best practice) |
| Siloed youth justice funding | Integrated child protection + housing + education + justice |
| Programs for "high-risk youth" | Family preservation to prevent pipeline to justice system |
| Government owns the data | Aboriginal data sovereignty—communities own evidence base |

---

## Part 4: THE APPLICATION DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Should You Even Apply? (A Decision Tree)

#### ✅ **Apply If You Can:**

1. **Build permanent community assets** (infrastructure, not just programs)
2. **Own the data** (Aboriginal data sovereignty agreement)
3. **Create Aboriginal employment** pathways beyond 2 years
4. **Document system failures**, not just youth "deficits"
5. **Connect to larger strategy** (e.g., Mindaroo funding, justice reinvestment sites)
6. **Refuse to replicate** failed models (detention alternatives, not "diversion to programs")

#### ❌ **Don't Apply If:**

1. You'd be replicating **what's already failed** (short-term mentoring without addressing housing, family, education)
2. Non-Aboriginal org would lead with ACCO as "partner" (extractive model)
3. No pathway to sustainability (grant ends, program dies)
4. You can't challenge the system while taking its money (co-optation risk)
5. Reporting requirements compromise **Aboriginal data sovereignty**

---

## Part 5: THE JUSTICEHUB-INFORMED APPLICATION (If You Decide to Apply)

### **What Would Make This Application Different?**

#### **1. Name the System as the Problem (Not Youth)**

**Standard Application Language:**
> "At-risk youth in our community engage in antisocial behavior due to lack of prosocial activities and role models."

**JusticeHub-Informed Language:**
> "Young people in our community experience systemic barriers including: child protection removal from family (87% of justice-involved youth), housing instability, education exclusion, police over-surveillance, and intergenerational trauma. These are systems problems, not youth problems. This grant will document how government agencies fail young people and build community-controlled alternatives."

---

#### **2. Center Aboriginal Data Sovereignty**

**Standard Application Language:**
> "We will collect outcome data and report to NSW Department of Communities and Justice on program effectiveness."

**JusticeHub-Informed Language:**
> "All data collected will be owned and governed by [Aboriginal organization]. We will share de-identified data with NSW DCJ for reporting requirements, but analysis and interpretation will remain with the community. After 2 years, this data will inform community-led policy advocacy and future program design, independent of government priorities."

---

#### **3. Demand Integration, Not Silos**

**Standard Application Language:**
> "We will provide mentoring, cultural activities, and employment readiness for justice-involved youth."

**JusticeHub-Informed Language:**
> "We will document the interconnected system failures young people experience: child protection removal → out-of-home care → school suspension → homelessness → police contact → detention. This grant will build evidence for integrated funding across child protection, housing, education, and justice—showing current siloed approach is designed to fail."

---

#### **4. Build Collective Power, Not Individual Outcomes**

**Standard Application Language:**
> "We will serve 30 young people over 2 years, with 80% showing improved school attendance and reduced offending."

**JusticeHub-Informed Language:**
> "We will work with 30 young people AND their families to build collective analysis of what causes justice involvement. Young people will document their own stories on JusticeHub platform, connecting their experiences to structural racism, intergenerational trauma, and systemic barriers. By year 2, these young people will present findings to NSW Parliament, judiciary, and police—positioning them as experts on justice reform, not 'at-risk youth.'"

---

#### **5. Name the International Benchmarks**

**Standard Application Language:**
> "Our program is innovative and will address gaps in current service provision."

**JusticeHub-Informed Language:**
> "NSW currently achieves 75%+ recidivism rates. International best practice shows:
> - Diagrama Spain: 13.6% recidivism (vs 80-96% traditional systems)
> - Missouri Model: 8% recidivism (vs 43-52% other US states)
> - Youth Koori Court NSW: 84% less custody time
>
> This grant will build community capacity to demand NSW meet international standards, not just 'improve' on current failure rates."

---

#### **6. The Sustainability Question**

**Standard Application Language:**
> "We will seek additional funding to continue the program beyond the 2-year grant period."

**JusticeHub-Informed Language:**
> "This grant will build permanent community assets:
> - 4 Aboriginal staff trained in evidence-based practice (Mindaroo compensation model: $180K)
> - JusticeHub platform deployment with community ownership
> - Documented evidence base owned by community
> - Relationships with Elders, families, young people independent of government funding
>
> By year 3, the community will offer training and consulting to other communities (revenue generation), advocate for policy change using owned data, and reduce dependence on government grants. Path to 35-40% self-sustainability by year 7."

## Part 6: THE QUESTIONS TO ASK NSW (In Your Application or Publicly)

### **Make Them Uncomfortable**

1. **"Why is NSW funding 10-year-olds in the justice system instead of raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14?"**
   - Forces them to defend indefensible policy
   - Positions you as aligned with international human rights standards

2. **"NSW's own evaluation shows Youth Koori Court reduces custody by 84%. Why isn't this mandatory for all Aboriginal young people?"**
   - Uses their evidence against them
   - Exposes that they have solutions but won't scale them

3. **"What percentage of justice-involved youth have child protection history? And why are these systems still siloed?"**
   - Names the pipeline they won't acknowledge
   - Demands integrated funding

4. **"If detention costs $500K-$900K per youth per year, and this grant is $150K/year for 30 youth, what does that say about NSW's priorities?"**
   - Exposes the math of punishment vs prevention
   - Positions you as fiscal realist, government as wasteful

5. **"Who will own the data generated by this grant? Will communities control how it's used for advocacy?"**
   - Asserts Aboriginal data sovereignty
   - Prevents extraction of community knowledge

6. **"How does a 2-year grant address intergenerational trauma from 250+ years of colonization?"**
   - Names the absurdity
   - Demands long-term investment

---

## Part 7: THE POLITICAL CONTEXT—Why This Grant Exists Now

### **Reading the Signals**

#### **What Changed?**
- Closing the Gap Target 11: **30% reduction in Aboriginal youth detention by 2031**
- NSW is failing spectacularly (likely getting worse, not better)
- 2026 election cycle approaching
- Media pressure on youth justice (both punitive and progressive)

#### **What This Grant Really Is:**
- **Political cover:** "We're investing in community-led solutions!"
- **Risk management:** If communities fail, NSW blames them; if communities succeed, NSW takes credit
- **Innovation theater:** Looks progressive without threatening police, courts, child protection budgets
- **Co-optation strategy:** Absorb community activists into service delivery so they stop advocating for systems change

#### **Why They Need You:**
- Aboriginal communities are the only credible voice on Closing the Gap
- International pressure on Australia's treatment of First Nations children
- Youth Koori Court evaluation made it politically impossible to ignore what works

#### **Why You Have Leverage:**
- NSW can't meet Target 11 without Aboriginal community leadership
- JusticeHub has evidence base they don't
- International models show NSW approach failing
- You can go public with their refusal to fund real solutions

---

## Part 8: THE COUNTER-PROPOSAL—What You'd Do With Real Investment

### **If NSW Actually Wanted to Close the Gap...**

Instead of $100K-$300K for 2-year programs, here's what evidence says would work:

#### **Option 1: Justice Reinvestment at Scale**
- **Model:** Bourke Maranguka (46% reduction in DV, community-led)
- **Cost:** $5-10M over 10 years per community
- **Evidence:** Proven to work, community-controlled, addresses root causes
- **Why NSW Won't:** Requires giving Aboriginal communities real power and long-term funding

#### **Option 2: Therapeutic Residential Alternatives**
- **Model:** Diagrama Spain (13.6% recidivism vs 80-96% traditional systems)
- **Cost:** $50-100M capital + $10-20M annual operating for 50-100 bed therapeutic facility
- **Evidence:** 40,000+ youth transformed, no youth suicides, family-centered
- **Why NSW Won't:** Threatens $2B detention industry, requires closure of existing facilities

#### **Option 3: Mandatory Youth Koori Court Diversion**
- **Model:** NSW's own BOCSAR evaluation (84% less custody)
- **Cost:** $20-30M to scale statewide with adequate Elders payments, case management
- **Evidence:** NSW-generated, proven to work
- **Why NSW Won't:** Takes discretion away from judges and police, empowers Elders over courts

#### **Option 4: JusticeHub National Infrastructure**
- **Model:** Mindaroo proposal ($9.5-13M over 5 years)
- **Cost:** $180K per community x 10 communities = $1.8M/year
- **Evidence:** 30+ peer-reviewed studies documented, 454 orgs mapped, proven platform
- **Why NSW Won't:** Communities would own the evidence base and use it to challenge government

---

## Part 9: THE CONCLUSION—Both/And Strategy

### **You Can Take the Money AND Challenge the System**

This is not a binary choice. The JusticeHub approach is:

#### ✅ **Take the Grant If:**
- You use it to build **permanent community assets** (infrastructure, not services)
- You **document system failure**, not just youth "deficits"
- You assert **Aboriginal data sovereignty**
- You connect to **larger strategy** (Mindaroo funding, justice reinvestment, policy advocacy)
- You refuse to be **performative Aboriginal partner** for non-Aboriginal lead orgs
- You create **Aboriginal employment** pathways beyond the grant
- You use the platform to **build collective power** across communities

#### ✅ **AND Publicly Challenge:**
- Why only $300K when detention costs $500K-$900K per youth?
- Why 2 years when international models need 10+ years?
- Why fund "innovative programs" instead of scaling proven Youth Koori Court?
- Why age 10 criminal responsibility instead of age 14?
- Why communities don't own the data they generate?
- Why "community-led" allows non-Aboriginal orgs to lead with ACCO "partners"?

---

### **The JusticeHub Thesis:**

**The grant is inadequate. The system is broken. The evidence is clear.**

**BUT:** Strategic use of this inadequate funding can build the community infrastructure needed to **demand** adequate solutions.

The goal is not to run a good 2-year program.

**The goal is to build permanent Aboriginal-controlled infrastructure that:**
1. Owns the evidence base on what works
2. Documents how government systems fail young people
3. Positions communities to demand policy change
4. Creates economic independence from government grants
5. Connects isolated communities into collective power
6. Makes it politically impossible for NSW to ignore what works

**You don't need their permission to do this. You need their money.**

Use the grant. Build the infrastructure. Own the data. Challenge the system.

That's the JusticeHub approach.

## Final Strategic Question for Your Team:

**"Are we using this grant to make the broken system slightly less broken...or to build the infrastructure that makes the system obsolete?"**

If the answer is the former, don't apply.

If the answer is the latter, here's the roadmap.
