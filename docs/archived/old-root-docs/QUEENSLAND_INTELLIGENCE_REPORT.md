## Recent Legislative Reforms (2024)

### Making Queensland Safer Act (December 2024)

**What changed**:
- Most significant shift in Queensland youth justice laws in history
- Fundamentally changes how young offenders are sentenced
- Leans toward harsher penalties aligning more closely with adult sentencing
- Represents punitive shift after years of diversionary focus

**ALMA Signal**: **Policy Mood Swing** (Punitive)
This represents a familiar failure mode: public pressure → legislative backlash → regression from evidence-based practice.

## Key Data Points

### Overrepresentation

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are **significantly over-represented** in Queensland youth detention.

**Source**: [AIHW - First Nations in Detention 2024](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/youth-justice/youth-detention-population-in-australia-2024/contents/summary/first-nations-young-people-in-detention)

### Culturally Responsive Programs

Research identifies that culturally responsive programs are characterized as:
- **Indigenous-led** (not just Indigenous-focused)
- **Place-based** (connected to Country)
- **Holistic** (addressing whole person, whole family)
- **Life-course oriented** (long-term support, not episodic)
- **Healing and family centered** (not punitive)

## ALMA Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Policy Tension (Prevention vs. Punishment)

**Observation**:
- $40M+ investment in community-based programs (2024-25)
- Simultaneously, "Making Queensland Safer Act" introduces harsher sentencing (Dec 2024)

**Interpretation**:
- Government is pursuing **dual track**: prevention programs + punitive laws
- This reflects political pressure (public safety rhetoric) vs. evidence base (diversion works)

**ALMA Signal**: **System Pressure** (policy mood swing under public/political pressure)

**Familiar failure mode**: This pattern appeared in other jurisdictions before punitive backlash (e.g., NT in 2018)

---

### Pattern 2: Indigenous Leadership Emerging

**Observation**:
- QATSICPP appointed as Youth Justice Peak Body (May 2024)
- Intensive On Country Program under Elder supervision
- Better Justice Together co-design strategy
- Cultural Family Partnership Service extended

**Interpretation**:
- Queensland is shifting from **consultation** to **structural governance** by Indigenous organizations
- This is a foundational change (not symbolic)

**ALMA Signal**: **Community Authority** (Indigenous decision-making power increasing)

**Critical next step**: Ensure funding follows authority (Indigenous orgs must be resourced, not just consulted)

---

### Pattern 3: Intensive Support Model

**Observation**:
- ICM (up to 36 hours/week per youth)
- Youth Co-Responder Teams (dedicated police + youth justice)
- Intensive Bail Initiative
- After Hours Services expansion

**Interpretation**:
- Queensland is investing in **high-touch, relationship-based** interventions
- This is evidence-aligned (MST, wraparound services)

**ALMA Signal**: **Implementation Capability** (requires skilled workforce, supervision, retention)

**Risk**: High-intensity programs burn out staff if not supported with training, supervision, manageable caseloads

---

### Pattern 4: Early Intervention Focus

**Observation**:
- Early Action Groups (8-16 year olds, before first offense)
- Youth Co-Responder Teams (proactive outreach)
- Community-Based Crime Action Grants (prevention funding)

**Interpretation**:
- Queensland is investing **upstream** (before justice contact)
- This is a **trajectory shift** (not just reacting to offending)

**ALMA Signal**: **System Trajectory** (moving toward primary prevention)

---

### Pattern 5: Restorative Justice Expansion

**Observation**:
- $5M over 2 years to expand restorative justice
- Youth Justice Conferencing programs
- Victim-offender reconciliation emphasis

**Interpretation**:
- Queensland is **institutionalizing** restorative practice (not pilot/marginal)

**ALMA Signal**: **Cultural Shift** (accountability without punishment)

---

## Comparison to Victoria (Emerging Pattern)

| Dimension | Victoria | Queensland |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Public Documentation** | High (13 programs visible) | Medium (improving with new website) |
| **Indigenous Leadership** | Koori-specific programs | Peak Body governance (structural) |
| **Recent Reforms** | Steady diversionary approach | **Dual track** (prevention + punishment) |
| **Budget Investment** | Not yet analyzed | $40M+ (2024-25) |
| **Policy Mood** | Stable | **Volatile** (punitive shift Dec 2024) |
| **Program Intensity** | Moderate | **High** (ICM up to 36hrs/week) |

**Key Difference**: Queensland is investing heavily in prevention WHILE toughening sentencing laws. Victoria has maintained steadier diversionary trajectory.

## ALMA Intelligence Gaps (Further Investigation Needed)

### 1. Implementation Fidelity
**Question**: Are these programs being delivered as designed?
**Gap**: We have policy documents, not implementation data
**Source needed**: Evaluation reports, program audits

### 2. Workforce Capacity
**Question**: Does Queensland have staff to deliver 36-hour/week ICM?
**Gap**: No data on workforce size, turnover, training
**Source needed**: Workforce strategy, retention data

### 3. Indigenous Program Outcomes
**Question**: Are Indigenous-led programs reducing overrepresentation?
**Gap**: Limited outcome data on Intensive On Country Program, QATSICPP impact
**Source needed**: QATSICPP evaluation reports, community feedback

### 4. Bail Compliance
**Question**: Are intensive bail programs preventing remand?
**Gap**: Need remand rate trends (before/after program expansion)
**Source needed**: AIHW detention data, QLD-specific trends

### 5. Legislative Impact
**Question**: How will "Making Queensland Safer Act" affect program effectiveness?
**Gap**: Too recent to have data (Dec 2024)
**Source needed**: Monitor 2025-2026 data for punitive shift impact

---

## Recommendations for ALMA Method Practice

### 1. Witta Harvest Node - Ground Truth These Patterns

**Questions for community**:
- "Does Queensland's 'dual track' (prevention + punishment) match your experience?"
- "Are intensive programs (ICM, YCRT) reaching the right youth?"
- "Is QATSICPP appointment creating real change or symbolic representation?"
- "What are you seeing that government data doesn't show?"

---

### 2. Track These Signals Over Time

**Monitor**:
1. **Remand rates** (Is intensive bail working?)
2. **Indigenous overrepresentation** (Is QATSICPP impact measurable?)
3. **Staff turnover** (Are intensive programs burning out workers?)
4. **Legislative rhetoric** (Is punitive language increasing?)
5. **Funding trajectories** (Does investment continue or decline?)

---

### 3. Connect to National Patterns

**Compare**:
- How does QLD's punitive shift (Dec 2024) compare to NT (2018)?
- What preceded the policy mood swing? (media coverage, political pressure)
- Did other states invest in prevention before backlash? (pattern recognition)

---

### 4. Protect Community Knowledge

**Action**:
- When Witta/QLD nodes share intelligence, mark as **Community Controlled**
- Government can't use lived experience patterns to justify punitive laws
- Consent model protects against knowledge extraction

## ALMA Method in Action

This report demonstrates ALMA's core functions:

**Memory**: Captured 15+ Queensland programs, $40M budget allocations, recent legislative shifts

**Pattern Recognition**: Detected policy tension (prevention + punishment), Indigenous leadership emerging, familiar failure mode (punitive backlash)

**Translation**: Converted government documents → actionable intelligence for practitioners and funders

**Next**: Ground-truth these patterns at Witta Harvest node, track signals over time, protect community knowledge

---

**Report Status**: Preliminary (based on web research + initial scraping)

**Next Phase**: Review extracted program data when scraping completes, integrate with database intelligence

**Prepared by**: ALMA Intelligence System
**Date**: 2025-12-31
