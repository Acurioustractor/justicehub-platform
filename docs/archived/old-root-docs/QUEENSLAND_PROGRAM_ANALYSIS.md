## Indigenous Programs - Detailed Analysis

### 1. Intensive On Country Program ⭐

**Model**: Elder-supervised, residential, cultural immersion

**Significance**:
- **On Country** = connection to land, culture, identity
- **Elder supervision** = Indigenous authority (not staff supervision)
- **Residential** = intensive, immersive

**ALMA Signal**: **Cultural Authority** (community decision-making)

**Status**: Recent launch (2024), part of "A Safer Queensland" strategy

---

### 2. QATSICPP as Youth Justice Peak Body

**Appointed**: May 2024

**Role**:
- Advise government on youth justice policy
- Strengthen community safety
- Reduce overrepresentation of First Nations youth

**Significance**: This is **structural governance**, not consultation
- Indigenous organization has authority (not advisory role)
- Evidence-based, community-driven approach

**ALMA Signal**: **Community Sovereignty** (system design power shifting to Indigenous leadership)

---

### 3. Youth Justice Family-Led Decision Making

**Model**: Culturally safe decision-making processes involving Aboriginal leadership

**Approach**: Families make decisions with cultural authority, not service providers

**ALMA Signal**: **Family Authority** (kinship governance)

---

---

### 5. Better Justice Together Strategy (2024-26)

**Framework**: Foundational action plan co-designed with community

**Focus**: 4 areas based on community input

**Goal**: Reduce overrepresentation through partnership

## Key Signals Detected

### Signal 1: Prevention Investment (Positive)

**Evidence**:
- 31% of programs are Prevention type
- Early Action Groups (8-16 year olds, before first offense)
- Proven Initiatives ($8.8M over 4 years)
- After Hours Youth Hubs

**Interpretation**: Queensland is investing **upstream** (before justice contact)

**ALMA Signal**: **System Trajectory** (moving toward primary prevention)

---

### Signal 2: Indigenous Leadership Emerging (Positive)

**Evidence**:
- QATSICPP appointed as Peak Body (May 2024)
- Intensive On Country Program (Elder-supervised)
- Youth Justice Family-Led Decision Making
- Better Justice Together co-design strategy
- Cultural Family Partnership extended ($3.3M/4 years)

**Interpretation**: Structural shift from consultation → governance

**ALMA Signal**: **Community Authority** (Indigenous organizations gaining system design power)

---

### Signal 3: High-Intensity Support Model (Positive with Risk)

**Evidence**:
- ICM (up to 36 hours/week)
- YCRT (dedicated police + youth justice teams)
- Intensive Bail Initiative ($2.4M)
- After Hours Services ($6.0M)

**Interpretation**: Queensland is betting on **relationship-intensive** interventions (evidence-aligned)

**ALMA Signal**: **Implementation Capability** (requires skilled workforce, manageable caseloads)

**Risk**: High-intensity programs burn out staff without adequate supervision, training, retention strategies

---

### Signal 4: Policy Tension / Punitive Backlash (Warning)

**Evidence**:
- "Making Queensland Safer Act" (December 2024)
- Shift toward harsher penalties aligning with adult sentencing
- Simultaneous with $40M prevention investment

**Interpretation**: Public/political pressure creating policy swing toward punishment **despite** prevention investment

**ALMA Signal**: **System Pressure** (familiar failure mode - policy mood swing)

**Historical Pattern**: This appeared in Northern Territory (2018), Victoria (2017) before punitive backlashes

**Critical Question**: Will punitive laws undermine prevention programs' effectiveness?

---

### Signal 5: Comprehensive Documentation (Positive)

**Evidence**:
- 39 programs publicly listed on government website
- Detailed program descriptions
- Target cohorts specified
- Budget allocations transparent

**Interpretation**: Queensland has **high system transparency** (more than VIC)

**ALMA Signal**: **System Maturity** (documentation indicates established infrastructure)

---

## Intelligence Gaps (Further Investigation Needed)

### 1. Implementation Fidelity
**Question**: Are these programs delivered as designed?
**Gap**: We have policy descriptions, not implementation data
**Need**: Evaluation reports, program audits, practitioner feedback

### 2. Workforce Capacity
**Question**: Does Queensland have staff to deliver 36 hrs/week ICM at scale?
**Gap**: No workforce data (size, turnover, training, caseloads)
**Need**: Workforce strategy documents, retention data

### 3. Indigenous Program Outcomes
**Question**: Is Intensive On Country Program reducing overrepresentation?
**Gap**: Too recent (2024 launch) for outcome data
**Need**: 2025-2026 evaluation reports, community feedback

### 4. Punitive Shift Impact
**Question**: How will December 2024 legislative changes affect program effectiveness?
**Gap**: Too recent to have data
**Need**: Monitor 2025 remand rates, sentencing patterns, program referrals

### 5. QATSICPP Authority
**Question**: Does Peak Body appointment translate to real influence?
**Gap**: Appointed May 2024, unclear if advisory or decision-making
**Need**: Review QATSICPP recommendations, government responses, funding flows

### 6. Geographic Coverage
**Question**: Are programs reaching regional/remote Queensland?
**Gap**: Most programs don't specify geographic scope beyond "statewide"
**Need**: Service delivery data by region

---

## ALMA Method Recommendations

### 1. Witta Harvest - Ground Truth

**Questions for community**:
- "Does Queensland's prevention investment match your lived experience?"
- "Are high-intensity programs (ICM, YCRT) reaching the right youth?"
- "Is QATSICPP Peak Body creating real change or symbolic representation?"
- "What does the punitive shift (Dec 2024) feel like on the ground?"
- "Are On Country programs Elder-led in practice or staff-led with Elder advisors?"

---

### 2. Track These Signals (2025-2026)

**Monitor**:
1. **Remand rates** (Did intensive bail programs reduce detention?)
2. **Indigenous overrepresentation** (Is QATSICPP impact measurable?)
3. **Workforce turnover** (Are high-intensity programs sustainable?)
4. **Legislative rhetoric** (Is punitive language increasing?)
5. **Program referrals** (Are prevention programs getting youth or bypassed for punishment?)

---

### 3. Compare to National Patterns

**Investigate**:
- How does QLD's Dec 2024 punitive shift compare to NT (2018)?
- What preceded the policy mood swing? (Media coverage, political pressure, specific incidents)
- Did other states invest in prevention before backlash? (Pattern recognition)

---

### 4. Protect Community Knowledge

**Action**:
- Witta/QLD node intelligence marked **Community Controlled**
- Government cannot use lived experience to justify punitive laws
- Consent model protects against extraction
