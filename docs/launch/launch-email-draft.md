Dear [First Name],

Today, we're launching JusticeHub—Australia's first comprehensive youth justice intelligence platform.

**The hard truth:**
- 24x more Indigenous kids are locked up than non-Indigenous
- 84.5% of young people in detention reoffend
- We spend $1.1 million per child, per year, to make things worse

**The harder truth:** Communities already have solutions that work. They're just invisible, underfunded, and disconnected.

That's what JusticeHub changes.

### What We've Built

**624+ community programs documented** with real outcome data—searchable by location, focus area, and success rates.

**ALMA Intelligence** — AI-powered research assistant with instant access to evidence-based programs, international best practices, and the data that proves community solutions outperform detention 5 to 1.

**4 Founding Basecamps** anchoring our network:
- **Oonchiumpa** (Alice Springs, NT) — Cultural healing achieving 95% reduced anti-social behavior
- **BG Fit** (Mount Isa, QLD) — Fitness-based mentorship with 85% diversion success
- **Mounty Yarns** (Mount Druitt, NSW) — Youth-led storytelling, 150+ stories published
- **PICC** (Townsville, QLD) — Pasifika community strength with 78% diversion rate

**34+ changemakers** already in the network—practitioners, researchers, advocates, and young people with lived experience.

### Why This Matters Now

The evidence is unanimous:
- **Community programs: 78% success rate** | Detention: 15.5%
- **Community cost: $58,000/year** | Detention: $1.1 million
- **Community approach: Healing** | Detention: Harm

Every dollar spent on detention is a dollar stolen from solutions that actually work.
