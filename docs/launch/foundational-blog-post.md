## The Headline

Every year, Australia spends over $1.1 million per child to lock up young people in detention centres that have an 84.5% failure rate.

Meanwhile, grassroots programs achieving 78% success rates operate on shoestring budgets, invisible to funders, disconnected from each other, and unknown to the families who need them most.

This is the crisis JusticeHub was built to solve.

## The Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About

Let's start with the numbers that keep us awake at night:

**24x higher.** That's how much more likely an Indigenous young person is to be incarcerated compared to their non-Indigenous peers.

**84.5% recidivism.** That's how many young people released from detention end up back in the system. Eight out of ten.

**$1.1 million per year.** That's what we spend per child to achieve those catastrophic results.

We don't have a youth crime problem. We have a youth justice system that manufactures more crime.

---

## The Solution That Already Exists

Here's what the media won't tell you: communities already have the cure.

Across Australia, grassroots organizations achieve outcomes that make detention look not just expensive, but absurd:

- **Groote Eylandt** saw 95% reduction in youth crime through cultural healing programs
- **BackTrack Youth Works** achieves 87% non-reoffending through practical skills and mentorship
- **Transition 2 Success** delivers 67% success at 95% lower cost than detention

These aren't pilot programs or theoretical models. They're working right now, transforming young lives, at a fraction of the cost of locking kids up.

So why doesn't everyone know about them?

## The Gap We're Filling

Three problems keep community solutions invisible:

**1. Fragmentation**
Each program operates in isolation. The youth worker in Mount Isa doesn't know what's working in Alice Springs. Funders can't compare approaches. Families can't find what's available.

**2. Invisibility**
While detention centres have million-dollar budgets and government backing, community programs survive on grants and goodwill. They have no marketing team, no lobbying power, no platform.

**3. No Evidence Base**
When policymakers ask "what works?", they get studies about American models from twenty years ago. They don't get real-time data from Australian communities showing what's working right now.

JusticeHub closes all three gaps.

## What JusticeHub Actually Does

### The Intelligence Layer

**ALMA** (our AI research assistant) has ingested every piece of youth justice evidence we could find—academic papers, government reports, international best practices, and real outcome data from Australian programs.

Ask ALMA a question, get an answer backed by evidence. "What programs work for 14-year-olds with trauma backgrounds?" "What's the cost comparison between detention and community diversion?" "Which international models have the lowest recidivism?"

### The Network Layer

**624+ community programs** documented with outcome data, searchable by location, target group, and approach.

**34+ practitioners and researchers** connected through the network, sharing what works.

**4 founding basecamps** anchoring the movement:
- Oonchiumpa in Alice Springs (cultural healing)
- BG Fit in Mount Isa (fitness mentorship)
- Mounty Yarns in Mount Druitt (youth media)
- PICC in Townsville (Pasifika community)

### The Transparency Layer

**The Empathy Ledger** tracks real outcomes, not just outputs. How many young people stayed out of trouble? Got back to school? Found work? Found housing?

**The Stewards program** lets supporters back specific programs and track exactly where their money goes.

---

## The Evidence Is In

We're not asking anyone to take this on faith. The data speaks:

| Approach | Success Rate | Cost Per Year | Evidence Base |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Community Programs | 78% | $58,000 | Strong |
| Youth Detention | 15.5% | $1,100,000 | Strong (negatively) |

Community programs are **5x more effective** at **19x lower cost**.

This isn't ideology. It's mathematics.

## Four Basecamps, One Mission

Our founding network hubs represent the diversity of what works:

**Oonchiumpa** (Alice Springs, NT)
*Cultural healing and deep listening on country*
95% reduction in anti-social behavior through connection to culture, country, and community.

**BG Fit** (Mount Isa, QLD)
*Fitness-based youth engagement*
85% diversion rate through sport, discipline, and mentorship.

**Mounty Yarns** (Mount Druitt, NSW)
*Youth-led storytelling*
150+ stories published, 30% of participants pursuing media careers. Challenging deficit narratives about Western Sydney.

**PICC** (Townsville, QLD)
*Pasifika community strength*
78% diversion success, supporting families through cultural connection and community.

Different approaches. Different communities. Same results: young people thriving instead of failing.

## What Comes Next

JusticeHub is infrastructure, not destination.

**For organizations:** Add your programs. Connect with peers. Access evidence that strengthens your case.

**For funders:** See what works. Track real outcomes. Make decisions based on data, not politics.

**For families:** Find programs near you. Share your story. Know that you're not alone.

**For young people:** Access services that actually help. Tell your story on your terms. Get paid for your expertise.

**For everyone:** This is the moment to prove that communities have the cure.
