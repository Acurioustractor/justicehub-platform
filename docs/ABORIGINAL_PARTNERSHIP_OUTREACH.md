## 1. Oochiumpa Consent Verification

### Contact: Kristy Bloomfield (Director, Oochiumpa Youth Services)

**Subject**: ALMA Integration - Consent Verification & Partnership Proposal

**Email Draft**:

```
Kristy,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm reaching out regarding the integration of Oochiumpa's youth services data into
ALMA (Adaptive Learning for Meaningful Accountability), a new intelligence system
within JusticeHub that centers Aboriginal-owned knowledge.

WHAT WE'VE DONE (with your data):

We've integrated Oochiumpa's outcomes into ALMA as THE FOUNDATION:
✅ 95% reduction in Operation Luna case management (18 of 19 young people)
✅ 72% school re-engagement (from 95% baseline disengagement)
✅ 89% program retention
✅ 71 service referrals completed
✅ 17 youth success stories (referenced from Empathy Ledger, not duplicated)

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Instead of government detention programs being the "default" in youth justice data,
Oochiumpa is now the BENCHMARK. When funders, researchers, or policy makers ask
"what works?", they see your outcomes first.

WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING:

1. **Community Controlled Consent**
   - You own the data (OCAP principles enforced in code)
   - Consent is revocable at any time
   - Permitted uses: JusticeHub platform, Intelligence Packs for Aboriginal orgs,
     funder reports (with your approval)

2. **Revenue Sharing (10%)**
   - Any Intelligence Pack or funder report sales that include Oochiumpa data
   - Revenue flows directly to Oochiumpa
   - Transparent tracking (you'll see exactly how your data is used)

3. **Attribution & Recognition**
   - Every use of Oochiumpa data includes attribution
   - Oochiumpa cited as the Aboriginal-owned benchmark
   - Your model showcased as replication guidance for other communities

4. **Intelligence FOR You**
   - Free Aboriginal Intelligence Pack showing:
     - Oochiumpa's impact in national context
     - Funding gaps and opportunities
     - Replication potential (how other communities could learn from your model)
     - Comparative data (your outcomes vs government programs)

WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU:

✅ Verify consent for the integration we've completed
✅ Permission to use Oochiumpa as an exemplar when reaching out to other
   Aboriginal organizations (NAAJA, APO NT, NATSILS, SNAICC)
✅ Feedback on the consent framework (is 10% revenue share appropriate?
   What else should we include?)

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

If you approve, we'll:
- Week 2: Use Oochiumpa's model (on-country, holistic, Elder-involved) to discover
  similar programs in NT (using AI)
- Week 3-4: Work with NAAJA/APO NT to document NT programs (using Oochiumpa as benchmark)
- Week 12: Deliver first Aboriginal Intelligence Pack to Oochiumpa, NAAJA, APO NT, NATSILS

This is not extractive data collection. This is partnership. Your intelligence shapes
the system.

Can we schedule a call to discuss?

Best,

## 2. National Aboriginal Organizations Outreach

### Target Organizations

1. **NATSILS** (National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Legal Services)
2. **SNAICC** (Secretariat of National Aboriginal & Islander Child Care)
3. **NAAJA** (North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency)
4. **APO NT** (Aboriginal Peak Organisations NT)

---

### 2A. NATSILS Outreach

**Contact**: National Coordinator / Policy Director

**Subject**: ALMA Intelligence System - Centering Aboriginal-Owned Knowledge in Youth Justice

**Email Draft**:

```
Dear NATSILS Team,

I'm writing to share a new development in youth justice intelligence that we believe
could support your advocacy work.

THE CONTEXT:

Currently, when funders or policy makers ask "what youth justice programs work?",
they rely on government reports that prioritize detention and mainstream programs.
Aboriginal-led alternatives are often footnotes, if mentioned at all.

THE SHIFT:

We've built ALMA (Adaptive Learning for Meaningful Accountability), an intelligence
system that inverts this hierarchy. Aboriginal-owned programs are weighted HIGHEST
in our portfolio framework:

- Community Authority: 30% (highest signal)
- Evidence Strength: 25%
- Harm Risk: 20%
- Implementation Capability: 15%
- Option Value: 10%

THE PROOF:

We started with Oochiumpa Youth Services (Aboriginal-owned, Central Australia/NT):
✅ 95% reduction in Operation Luna case management
✅ 72% school re-engagement (from 95% disengaged)
✅ 89% program retention
✅ Cost: $X per participant vs $XXX,000/year in detention

Oochiumpa is now the BENCHMARK in ALMA. Government programs are evaluated
against it, not the other way around.

WHAT WE'RE ASKING:

1. **Consent Framework Guidance**
   - We've implemented OCAP principles in code (not just docs)
   - Community Controlled consent with revenue sharing (10%)
   - Is our approach aligned with NATSILS' standards?

2. **Cultural Protocol Review**
   - Hard blocks on sacred fields (enforced at database level)
   - Attribution required for all Aboriginal data
   - What are we missing?

3. **Program Identification Support**
   - What Aboriginal-led youth justice programs should we document?
   - Who are the right contacts in each state/territory?

WHAT WE'RE OFFERING:

1. **Free Aboriginal Intelligence Pack** (delivered to NATSILS + member orgs)
   - National overview of Aboriginal-led programs
   - Funding gaps and opportunities
   - Comparative data (Aboriginal-led vs government detention outcomes)
   - Replication guidance (how Oochiumpa model could scale)

2. **Policy Advocacy Support**
   - Data-backed briefs for "Raise the Age" campaigns
   - ROI analysis (community alternatives vs detention)
   - Oochiumpa outcomes as proven alternative

3. **Revenue Sharing**
   - 10% of Intelligence Pack sales flow to contributing Aboriginal orgs
   - Transparent tracking (every use documented)

THE ASK:

Can we schedule a call to discuss partnership?

We're not asking NATSILS to provide data. We're asking for guidance on how to
do this ethically, and whether ALMA intelligence could support your advocacy work.

### 2B. SNAICC Outreach

**Contact**: CEO / Research & Policy Director

**Subject**: ALMA Intelligence - Centering Aboriginal Child & Youth Wellbeing Knowledge

**Email Draft**:

```
Dear SNAICC Team,

I'm reaching out regarding a new intelligence system that centers Aboriginal-owned
knowledge in youth justice and child wellbeing.

THE PROBLEM:

Child protection and youth justice systems rely on data that centers government
programs. Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations (ACCOs) like Oochiumpa
achieve exceptional outcomes but are often underfunded and undocumented.

THE OPPORTUNITY:

We've built ALMA to change this. It's an intelligence system where:
- **Community Authority** is the highest-weighted signal (30%)
- Aboriginal-owned programs like Oochiumpa are the benchmark
- Evidence includes both quantitative outcomes AND lived experience stories

THE EXAMPLE:

Oochiumpa Youth Services (Central Australia):
✅ 95% reduction in offending (Operation Luna list)
✅ 72% school re-engagement
✅ On-country experiences, Elder involvement, holistic healing
✅ Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation

In ALMA, Oochiumpa isn't a "case study" - it's the STANDARD. Government programs
are compared to it.

WHAT WE NEED FROM SNAICC:

1. **Guidance on Child Wellbeing Data**
   - We're focused on youth justice, but it overlaps with child protection
   - What ethical considerations should we prioritize?
   - Which ACCOs are doing transformative work?

2. **Cultural Safety Review**
   - Our consent framework includes OCAP principles, revenue sharing (10%),
     attribution requirements
   - Does this align with SNAICC's framework?

3. **Connection to Member Organisations**
   - We want to document Aboriginal-led programs WITH communities, not TO them
   - Can SNAICC help facilitate introductions?

WHAT WE'RE OFFERING:

1. **Free Intelligence Pack for SNAICC + Members**
   - Comprehensive mapping of Aboriginal-led child/youth programs
   - Funding gap analysis
   - Replication guidance (how successful models could scale)

2. **Policy Support**
   - Data for "Raise the Age" advocacy
   - Evidence that community alternatives work (and cost less than detention)
   - Comparative analysis (ACCO outcomes vs mainstream child protection)

3. **Revenue Model Co-Design**
   - We're piloting 10% revenue sharing with Oochiumpa
   - Want SNAICC input: Is this appropriate? What else should we include?

Can we discuss partnership?

Best,
[Your Name]
ACT Development Team / JusticeHub

### 2C. NAAJA Outreach (NT-Specific)

**Contact**: CEO / Youth Justice Program Lead

**Subject**: NT Youth Justice Intelligence - Oochiumpa as NT Benchmark

**Email Draft**:

```
Dear NAAJA Team,

I'm writing to share a new development in NT youth justice intelligence, and to
explore partnership.

THE NT CONTEXT:

NT has the highest youth detention rate in Australia. 96% of detained youth are
Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander. Royal Commission reports documented systemic
failures, but viable alternatives are rarely highlighted.

THE ALTERNATIVE EXISTS:

Oochiumpa Youth Services (Alice Springs) achieved:
✅ 95% reduction in Operation Luna case management (18 of 19 young people)
✅ 72% school re-engagement
✅ 89% program retention
✅ Aboriginal-owned, on-country experiences, Elder involvement

We've integrated Oochiumpa into ALMA (our intelligence system) as the NT BENCHMARK.

WHAT WE'RE DOING (WEEK 3-4):

NT-focused data gathering using Oochiumpa as the model:
- Government baseline: Royal Commission reports, AIHW data, Productivity Commission
- AI discovery: Find programs LIKE Oochiumpa (on-country, holistic, Aboriginal-led)
- Community co-creation: Work WITH NAAJA to document programs, not scrape without permission

WHAT WE NEED FROM NAAJA:

1. **Program Identification**
   - Are there other programs like Oochiumpa in NT?
   - Which Aboriginal-led initiatives should we document?
   - Who are the right contacts?

2. **Community Verification**
   - We'll scrape government sites (public domain)
   - But we want NAAJA to verify: What's missing? What's misrepresented?

3. **Co-Design Intelligence Pack**
   - What would be useful for NAAJA's advocacy work?
   - Funding gaps? Replication guidance? Comparative outcomes?

WHAT WE'RE OFFERING:

1. **Free NT Intelligence Pack** (Week 12 delivery)
   - All NT programs documented (government + community)
   - Oochiumpa as NT success story
   - Gap analysis: What's missing, what's underfunded
   - ROI data: Community alternatives vs detention costs

2. **Policy Advocacy Support**
   - Data for "Raise the Age NT" campaign
   - Comparative analysis (Oochiumpa vs detention outcomes)
   - Replication guidance (how to scale Oochiumpa model)

3. **Revenue Sharing**
   - If NAAJA contributes data/knowledge, 10% revenue share on Intelligence Pack sales
   - Transparent attribution tracking

THE VISION:

By Week 12, NAAJA can walk into a funder meeting and say: "Here's what works
in NT (Oochiumpa + similar programs). Here's what's failing (detention).
Here's the gap (funding). Here's the ask."

Can we schedule a call?

### 2D. APO NT Outreach

**Contact**: Chair / Policy Coordinator

**Subject**: NT Aboriginal-Led Programs Intelligence - Partnership Opportunity

**Email Draft**:

```
Dear APO NT Team,

I'm reaching out regarding a new intelligence system (ALMA) that could support
APO NT's advocacy for Aboriginal-led solutions in youth justice.

THE OPPORTUNITY:

We've integrated Oochiumpa Youth Services into ALMA as the NT benchmark:
✅ 95% offending reduction
✅ 72% school re-engagement
✅ Aboriginal-owned, community-controlled

Oochiumpa proves that Aboriginal-led programs work. ALMA makes this visible to funders.

WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING:

**Week 3-4: NT Deep Dive**
- Document 30+ NT youth justice programs
- Balanced approach: 15 government, 15 community (with Oochiumpa as baseline)
- AI discovery to find programs undocumented by government
- Community verification (APO NT reviews before database entry)

WHAT WE NEED FROM APO NT:

1. **Member Organisation Connections**
   - APO NT represents Aboriginal organisations across NT
   - Can you facilitate introductions to programs like Oochiumpa?

2. **System-Wide Perspective**
   - What's working in NT (beyond what government reports show)?
   - What's missing (service gaps, funding gaps)?

3. **Intelligence Pack Co-Design**
   - What would be useful for APO NT's advocacy?
   - Focus on remote communities? Youth detention alternatives?

WHAT WE'RE OFFERING:

1. **Free NT Intelligence Pack**
   - Comprehensive mapping of NT programs
   - Oochiumpa outcomes as benchmark
   - Gap analysis FOR Aboriginal orgs (what could be scaled, what's underfunded)

2. **Revenue Model**
   - If APO NT member orgs contribute data, 10% revenue share
   - Attribution tracking (every use documented)

3. **Policy Support**
   - Data for NT-specific advocacy
   - Comparative analysis (Aboriginal-led vs detention)

Can we discuss partnership?

Best,
[Your Name]

## 3. Key Messages Across All Outreach

### Core Narrative

**Old Model** (Extractive):
- Government collects data
- Aboriginal orgs asked for "input"
- Intelligence sold to funders
- Revenue goes to platform owners
- Communities get "acknowledgment"

**ALMA Model** (Regenerative):
- Aboriginal orgs provide intelligence (Oochiumpa first)
- ALMA centers their knowledge (highest signal weight)
- Intelligence shared with Aboriginal orgs FIRST (free)
- Revenue shared with contributors (10%)
- Communities co-own the intelligence economy

### Evidence of Commitment

**Not Just Words - Enforced in Code**:
✅ OCAP principles (database constraints, not docs)
✅ Community Authority highest signal (30% portfolio weight)
✅ Revenue sharing tracked in consent ledger
✅ Sacred fields hard blocked (can't access without error)
✅ Attribution required (every use documented)
✅ Consent revocable (real-time, not batch)

### The Ask

**We're NOT asking for data extraction.**

We're asking:
1. **Guidance**: Is our consent framework ethical? What are we missing?
2. **Connections**: Which Aboriginal-led programs should we document (WITH permission)?
3. **Partnership**: Could ALMA intelligence support your advocacy work?

---

## 4. Follow-Up Strategy

### Timeline

**Week 1 (Now)**:
- Send outreach emails
- Follow up with phone calls (3-5 days)

**Week 2**:
- Schedule Zoom calls with respondents
- Show ALMA demo (Oochiumpa integration)
- Get feedback on consent framework

**Week 3-4**:
- Work WITH partners to document NT programs
- Community verification before database entry

**Week 12**:
- Deliver Aboriginal Intelligence Packs
- Oochiumpa first, then NAAJA, APO NT, NATSILS, SNAICC

### Success Metrics

**Week 1-2 Goal**:
- ✅ Oochiumpa consent verified
- 2+ national partnerships initiated (NATSILS, SNAICC)
- 2+ NT partnerships initiated (NAAJA, APO NT)

**Week 12 Goal**:
- 4+ Aboriginal orgs using ALMA intelligence
- Consent framework endorsed by national authority (NATSILS/SNAICC)
- Revenue sharing operational (Oochiumpa receives first payment)

---

## 5. Risk Mitigation

### Anticipated Concerns

**Concern 1**: "We've been burned before - extractive research, no benefit to community"

**Response**:
- Show Oochiumpa integration (they're the benchmark, not a case study)
- Revenue sharing (10%, transparent tracking)
- Consent revocable (real-time, enforced in code)
- Intelligence FOR Aboriginal orgs first (free), funders pay

---

**Concern 2**: "Sample size too small (n=21) - not 'rigorous'"

**Response**:
- Oochiumpa: 95% success with n=21
- Government detention: 40% re-offending with n=1000+
- We prioritize OUTCOMES over sample size
- Community Authority signal (30%) reflects this

---

**Concern 3**: "Cultural safety - will sacred knowledge be protected?"

**Response**:
- Hard blocks in database (sacred fields throw errors, not warnings)
- OCAP enforced at tool level (code, not docs)
- Stories stay in Empathy Ledger (cross-database reference, not duplication)
- Community Controlled consent (revocable at any time)

---

**Concern 4**: "What's in it for us? This benefits JusticeHub, not communities"

**Response**:
- Revenue sharing (10% to contributors)
- Intelligence Pack (free for Aboriginal orgs, sold to funders)
- Policy advocacy support (data for "Raise the Age" campaigns)
- Funding gap analysis (helps Aboriginal orgs identify grant opportunities)
- Oochiumpa model showcased (replication = more funding for similar programs)
