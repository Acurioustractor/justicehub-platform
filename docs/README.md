## What is ALMA?

> **ALMA** = **A**uthentic **L**earning for **M**eaningful **A**ccountability
>
> Also Spanish/Latin for **"soul"** - because true impact measurement captures the human spirit.

ALMA is JusticeHub's intelligence layer - a community-powered evidence platform proving that community-based youth justice works better than detention.

**Key Stats:**
- Detention costs **$3,320/day** vs Community **$150/day**
- Detention recidivism: **84.5%** vs Community: **20-40%**
- Every diversion saves **$570,000/year**

## For AI Agents

### Primary Reference
Start with [knowledge/JUSTICEHUB.md](knowledge/JUSTICEHUB.md) - contains:
- What JusticeHub is
- What ALMA means and does
- Data model and entities
- API reference
- Cultural protocols

### Vision & Strategy
- [vision/ALMA-2.0-VISION.md](vision/ALMA-2.0-VISION.md) - Full roadmap
- [vision/ALMA-ACT-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md](vision/ALMA-ACT-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md) - ACT ecosystem

### Technical Systems
Each system has an `index.md` entry point:
- [systems/alma/](systems/alma/) - ALMA intelligence
- [systems/scraper/](systems/scraper/) - Data ingestion
- [systems/empathy-ledger/](systems/empathy-ledger/) - EL integration

## For Humans

### New to JusticeHub?
1. Read [knowledge/JUSTICEHUB.md](knowledge/JUSTICEHUB.md)
2. Explore [vision/ALMA-2.0-VISION.md](vision/ALMA-2.0-VISION.md)

### Building a Feature?
1. Check [systems/](systems/) for relevant system docs
2. Use spec template from [specs/TEMPLATE.md](specs/TEMPLATE.md)

### Deploying?
See [operations/deployment/QUICK_START.md](operations/deployment/QUICK_START.md)

## Cultural Protocols

**Sacred Boundaries (NEVER Allowed):**
1. Youth profiling - No risk scores or predictions
2. ALMA scores - Use signals (direction), not scores (rankings)
3. Data duplication - Link-based architecture only
4. Knowledge extraction - Requires consent

**OCAP Principles:**
- **O**wnership - Communities own their data
- **C**ontrol - Communities set access rules
- **A**ccess - Tiered based on consent
- **P**ossession - Data portability guaranteed
