## üöÄ Execute Now (3 Options)

### Option 1: Test First (Recommended - 5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Validate Firecrawl setup with 5 URLs before committing to full scrape

```bash
# 1. Ensure Firecrawl API key is set
echo "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-your-key" >> .env

# 2. Run test
NODE_OPTIONS='--require dotenv/config' npx tsx src/scripts/discovery/test-askizzy-scrape.ts
```

**What it does:**
- Scrapes 5 diverse Ask Izzy URLs
- Tests Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Queensland
- Shows data quality examples
- Imports to database
- Estimates full scrape results

**Expected output:**
```
Services found: 50-200
Services imported: 40-180
Duplicates: 10-20
Estimated full scrape: 2,500-10,000 services
Cost estimate: $0.50-1
```

**If successful:** Continue to Option 2
**If fails:** Check Firecrawl API key and connection

---

### Option 2: Generate URL List (1 minute)

**Purpose:** Create complete list of 252 URLs to scrape

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS='--require dotenv/config' npx tsx src/scripts/discovery/generate-askizzy-urls.ts
```

**What it creates:**
- `/data/askizzy-urls.json` - Full URL list with metadata
- `/data/askizzy-urls.csv` - Easy-to-view spreadsheet

**Output shows:**
- Total URLs: 252
- High priority: ~72 (major cities + statewide)
- Cost estimate: $0.50-1
- Time estimate: ~5 hours
- Expected services: 3,000-10,000

---

### Option 3: Full Scrape (Currently needs building)

The comprehensive scraper needs to be created. It will:
- Load URLs from `data/askizzy-urls.json`
- Scrape systematically with progress tracking
- Handle errors gracefully
- Save checkpoints every 50 URLs
- Estimate: 5-8 hours runtime

**To build:** See template in [INFOXCHANGE_SCRAPING_STRATEGY.md](./INFOXCHANGE_SCRAPING_STRATEGY.md)

## üìä Expected Results

### Ask Izzy Scraping (252 URLs)

| Metric | Conservative | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Services found | 2,500 | 10,000 |
| After deduplication (40%) | 1,500 | 6,000 |
| Youth justice relevant (50%) | 750 | 3,000 |
| **Final database growth** | **1,150 services** | **3,400 services** |

**Cost:** $0.50-1 (Firecrawl)
**Time:** 5 hours (1 request/2 seconds)

### Current Database: 403 services
### After scrape: **1,550-3,800 services** (285%-845% growth!)

## üîë Why This Works

### 1. Ask Izzy is Public & Open Source
- Public search interface (no login required)
- 450,000+ services available
- Built on Infoxchange Service Directory
- Open source on GitHub

### 2. Firecrawl Handles Complexity
- JavaScript/React sites (Ask Izzy is Next.js)
- Dynamic loading with wait times
- LLM extraction for unstructured data
- Automatic rate limiting

### 3. Ethical Approach
- Conservative rate limits (1 req/2 sec)
- Clear attribution to Infoxchange
- Youth justice focus (subset of data)
- Seeking official partnership in parallel

### 4. High ROI
- **Cost:** $1-2 total
- **Time:** 5 hours automated
- **Result:** 1,500-6,000 services
- **Cost per service:** $0.0003-0.0013

Compare to manual: $5-10/service, weeks of work

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Running Full Scrape

1. **Test first** with 5 URLs to validate approach
2. **Check Firecrawl credits** - ensure you have enough
3. **Database backup** - backup Supabase before bulk import
4. **Monitor first 50** - watch for errors/issues
5. **Weekend run** - best to run when you can monitor

### During Scrape

- Don't stop mid-scrape (wastes Firecrawl credits)
- Watch for rate limit errors
- Check database periodically
- Note any errors for later debugging

### After Scrape

1. Run data quality report
2. Check for duplicates
3. Review category assignments
4. Validate contact information
5. Update frontend to show new services

## üìß Parallel: Email Infoxchange

While scraping, also pursue official partnership:

**To:** database@infoxchange.org
**Subject:** Partnership Request - Youth Justice Service Directory

```
Hi Infoxchange Team,

I'm building JusticeHub (justicehub.au), a specialized youth justice
service directory for Australia.

We're currently scraping Ask Izzy's public interface for youth justice
services using:
- Conservative rate limits (1 request/2 seconds)
- 6 relevant categories only
- Clear attribution to Infoxchange
- 252 systematic searches

Current approach:
- Using Firecrawl for respectful scraping
- Focusing on youth justice subset
- Adding value through specialized categorization
- Free public access

We'd prefer official API access to:
1. Reduce our scraping footprint
2. Get more complete/accurate data
3. Properly partner and attribute
4. Share insights on youth justice service gaps

Would you be open to discussing API access or partnership terms?

Best regards,
[Your name]
JusticeHub
[Your email]
```
