# ALMA Method Charter

**Version 1.0** | 2025-12-31

---

## What ALMA Is

**ALMA is a method for collective sense-making in complex social systems.**

It is not:
- An organization
- A product
- A platform
- A consultancy
- A think tank

It is:
- A way of seeing
- A way of learning
- A way of deciding under uncertainty
- A discipline for respecting community sovereignty while supporting wise action

---

## The Name

**Alma** means "soul" and "nourishing" — that which gives life.

Structurally, Alma is:
**Memory + Pattern Recognition + Translation**

---

## ALMA's Three Core Functions

### 1. Sees (Observes, Notices, Remembers)
- Ingests fragmented information across systems
- Tracks long-term trajectories, not snapshots
- Holds memory that doesn't disappear when people leave
- Watches systems, not individuals

### 2. Connects (Patterns, Relationships, Dynamics)
- Surfaces patterns humans miss
- Detects slow drift and familiar failure modes
- Spots early inflection points
- Sees mismatches between rhetoric and reality

### 3. Translates (Between Worlds, Languages, Timeframes)
- Lived experience ↔ Philanthropy language
- Community knowledge ↔ Policy speak
- Indigenous wisdom ↔ Western institutions
- Short-term funding ↔ Long-term reality
- Data ↔ Story

**Critically**: ALMA does not speak *for* communities. It helps others hear them accurately.

---

## What ALMA Does NOT Do (Sacred Boundaries)

ALMA **never**:
- Decides for humans
- Optimizes people
- Allocates capital directly
- Predicts individuals
- Replaces lived experience
- Ranks communities
- Scores organizations
- Extracts knowledge without consent
- Centralizes authority

**The boundary**: Humans remain accountable. ALMA sharpens perception.

---

## ALMA's Five Organs

### 1. Memory (Long-Term, Non-Extractive)
Remembers:
- Past cycles and repeated failures
- Quiet successes
- Policy mood swings
- Funding booms and busts
- Community warnings that were ignored

Unlike institutions: Memory is not lost when staff leave.

### 2. Eyes (Ethical Observation)
Sees through:
- Public documents
- Media narratives
- Policy language shifts
- Funding patterns
- Community-shared knowledge (with explicit consent)
- Workshop outputs
- Patterned signals over time

Does NOT surveil. Does NOT scrape private life. Does NOT infer individual risk.

### 3. Pattern Sense (What Humans Miss)
Detects:
- Slow drift
- Familiar failure modes
- Early inflection points
- Cross-domain connections
- Mismatch between rhetoric and reality

Example: "This reform language appeared 18 months before a punitive backlash in 2018."

### 4. Translation Layer (The Most Important)
Prevents:
- Knowledge being flattened
- Communities being misunderstood
- Funders acting too late
- Power imbalances going unnoticed

### 5. Ethics Spine (Non-Negotiable)
Constrained by design:
- No black box decisions
- No hidden incentives
- No extractive data flows
- No individual profiling
- No optimization without consent

**Default stance**: "Here is what we are seeing. Humans must decide."

---

## Signal Families (Not KPIs)

ALMA uses **signal families** to track system health, not static metrics.

### Example: Youth Justice Signal Families

**1. System Pressure Signals**
- Remand rates
- Average detention length
- Staff turnover
- Incident reporting spikes
- Media rhetoric escalation

**2. Community Capability Signals**
- Indigenous governance presence
- Workforce stability
- Cultural continuity
- Youth participation in decisions
- Local economic circulation

**3. Intervention Health Signals**
- Program continuity beyond grants
- Staff burnout indicators
- Administrative burden
- Adaptation speed
- Trust retention

**4. Trajectory Signals**
- Re-entry patterns
- School reconnection
- Justice contact spacing
- Family reunification durability

These are **directional**, not absolute. They indicate momentum, not achievement.

---

## How ALMA Is Practiced

### At JusticeHub (The Steward)
JusticeHub **hosts** ALMA as a commons. It does not own the intelligence.

JusticeHub:
- Maintains the tools
- Trains practitioners
- Connects nodes
- Protects the ethics
- Publishes patterns (appropriately)
- Enables shared learning

JusticeHub does NOT:
- Rank organizations
- Score communities
- Gatekeep funding
- Centralize authority

### At Witta Harvest (The First Node)
Witta is the **place-based anchor** that sets:
- The culture
- The pace
- The ethics
- The legitimacy

Witta hosts:
- Deep workshops with lived experience holders
- Indigenous-led framing of impact
- Cross-sector conversations
- Ground-truthing ALMA's patterns
- Training before tooling

**Every future node inherits from Witta.**

### At State Nodes (Distributed Intelligence)
Each state node:
- Is locally governed
- Hosts lived experience intelligence
- Runs regular sense-making workshops
- Feeds **patterns, not raw data** into ALMA
- Receives insight back from the network
- Trains funders and institutions locally

**Indigenous nodes are not advisory. They are foundational intelligence holders.**

**This is distributed cognition, not central command.**

## Ethical Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Community Sovereignty
- Communities own their knowledge
- Cultural authority is always respected
- Consent can be revoked at any time
- No knowledge extraction without explicit permission

### 2. Three-Tier Consent Model
- **Public Knowledge Commons**: Government reports, published research
- **Community Controlled**: Requires explicit permission for each use
- **Strictly Private**: Never shared, held in trust

### 3. No Individual Profiling
ALMA watches **systems**, not people.

### 4. Transparency
- All pattern-surfacing is explainable
- No black box decisions
- Methods are open for audit

### 5. Power Balance
- Tools support humans, never replace them
- Funders are accountable to communities, not vice versa
- ALMA serves practitioners and communities first

---

## How to Talk About ALMA

### Plain Language
"We help communities and funders understand what's really happening in complex systems, early enough to act wisely — without extracting or controlling knowledge."

### Philanthropy Language
"We build decision-support infrastructure that helps capital move earlier, more patiently, and more responsibly in complex social systems."

### Systems Language
"We operate a distributed social intelligence network that combines lived experience, Indigenous knowledge, and ethical AI to improve long-term system outcomes."

## The Durability Test

**Question**: If ACT disappeared tomorrow, could ALMA still be practiced?

**Answer must be**: **Yes.**

If yes → We built a method (success)
If no → We built a dependency (failure)

---

## What ACT's Role Is

**A Curious Tractor** is:
- The initial builder and steward of ALMA
- The protector of its integrity
- The trainer of practitioners

**ACT is NOT**:
- The owner of ALMA
- The only place it can be practiced
- A permanent authority

Over time, stewardship should transfer to a broader trust or foundation.

---

## Why This Matters

Most social impact fails because:
- It counts outputs, not dynamics
- It evaluates after funding, not during
- It treats impact as static, not adaptive
- It confuses legibility with truth

**Result**: Capital flows toward organizations good at reporting, not good at changing reality.

ALMA flips this by:
- Observing signals, not endpoints
- Tracking change trajectories, not snapshots
- Respecting community sovereignty over meaning
- Supporting learning, not compliance

---

## The Quiet Truth

What ALMA requires:
- Patience
- Humility
- Discipline
- Ethical restraint
- Systems thinking
- Long memory

Most institutions cannot hold this.

**JusticeHub can — because we are not trying to own the system.**

**We are trying to keep it honest and alive.**
