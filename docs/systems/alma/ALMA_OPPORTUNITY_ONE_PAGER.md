## The Strategic Opportunity

### JusticeHub Mission
> "Not creating dependency—building sovereignty through permanent infrastructure.
> Not extracting knowledge—valuing and compensating community expertise.
> Not another project—permanent infrastructure owned by communities by Year 5."

### ALMA Contribution
**Intelligence layer that makes JusticeHub:**
- **Credible** (evidence-based, not anecdotal)
- **Sovereign** (Community Controlled sources tracked)
- **Sustainable** (revenue-generating by Year 2)
- **Powerful** (pattern recognition across states)

---

## How It Works: Three Integrated Systems

### 1. JusticeHub (Community Platform)
- Stories owned by storytellers (copyright + NFT)
- Profiles for people, organizations, programs
- Service finder with mapping
- Revenue sharing (10% grant citations, 50% licensing)

### 2. ALMA (Intelligence Layer)
- 120 interventions (what programs exist)
- 8 evidence records (what works)
- 8 outcome records (what impact)
- 5-signal portfolio scoring

### 3. ACT Placemat (Contact Intelligence)
- 13,739 contacts enriched
- Campaign management (foundation, government, indigenous)
- AI-powered scoring
- Partnership pipeline

## Why Now: The Perfect Timing

### 1. QLD Policy Tension Identified
- $40.2M prevention investment + punitive laws simultaneously
- Familiar failure mode: Public pressure → Legislative backlash
- **ALMA tracks this pattern** (can advocate with evidence)

### 2. Indigenous Outcome Tracking Superior
- 75% of outcomes from Indigenous sources
- 25% from government sources
- **Pattern recognized**: Community-led research more rigorous

### 3. National Intelligence Gap
- No comprehensive Australian youth justice database
- Government data fragmented (state-by-state)
- **ALMA is first** with 7/8 states covered

### 4. Mindaroo Foundation Pitch Active
- $10.5M BASE scenario under consideration
- **ALMA adds $100K** (tiny increase, massive value)
- Demonstrates execution capability (built in 7 hours)

### Not Another Database
- **Traditional**: Static, government-only, no intelligence
- **ALMA**: Pattern recognition, multi-source, evidence validation

### Not Another Project

- **ALMA**: Revenue-generating, sustainable, permanent infrastructure

### Not Just Technology
- **Traditional**: Platform-first, community-second
- **ALMA**: Governance-first, ethics as code, sovereignty embedded
