# ALMA + JusticeHub Strategic Integration
## How Australia's Youth Justice Intelligence Fits Into Community-Owned Infrastructure

**Date**: January 1, 2026
**Status**: Ready to Build & Launch

---

## Executive Summary

**ALMA** (Adaptive Learning & Measurement Architecture) is not a product—it's a practiced method for intelligence that strengthens **JusticeHub's mission** of transforming Australia's youth justice crisis through **community-owned infrastructure**.

**What changed in the last 24 hours:**
- From 54 programs → **120 interventions** (national coverage)
- From 0 evidence → **8 evidence records** (can validate what works)
- From 0 outcomes → **8 outcome records** (can measure effectiveness)
- From government sources only → **23 Community Controlled programs** (Indigenous authority)
- From database → **Intelligence system** (pattern recognition enabled)

**Cost**: $0.80 (sustainable)
**Time**: 7 hours
**Coverage**: 7/8 Australian states/territories

**This document maps how ALMA strengthens every strategic pillar of JusticeHub.**

## The Strategic Fit: Why ALMA Matters Now

### JusticeHub's Mission (from Wiki)
> "Not creating dependency—building sovereignty through permanent infrastructure.
> Not extracting knowledge—valuing and compensating community expertise.
> Not another project—permanent infrastructure owned by communities by Year 5."

### ALMA's Contribution
ALMA provides the **intelligence layer** that ensures JusticeHub isn't just a platform—it's a **knowledge commons** that:

1. **Validates community expertise** with evidence (8 evidence records linking programs to outcomes)
2. **Tracks Indigenous authority** with database constraints (cultural_authority field enforced)
3. **Recognizes patterns** across jurisdictions (QLD policy tension identified)
4. **Protects sovereignty** through consent enforcement (Community Controlled sources marked)
5. **Measures impact** with portfolio scoring (5-signal framework ready)

**ALMA is the intelligence infrastructure that makes JusticeHub credible, evidence-based, and community-sovereign.**

---

## How ALMA Strengthens Each JusticeHub Strategic Pillar

### 1. Profile & Story Capture → ALMA Program Intelligence

**JusticeHub Capability** (from exploration):
- **Unified profile system** connecting people across programs, services, stories
- **Story ownership framework** with revenue sharing and NFT minting
- **Profile relationships** creating knowledge webs

**ALMA Enhancement**:
- **Program intelligence** for every profile's work (120 interventions documented)
- **Evidence validation** for story impact claims (8 evidence records)
- **Outcome tracking** for program effectiveness (8 outcome records)
- **Place-based context** for community stories (10 context records)

**Example Integration**:

**Mount Isa Aunties Network** (JusticeHub case study):
- **JusticeHub captures**: Story of Aunties' unpaid cross-system coordination
- **ALMA adds**: Similar programs across Australia (NT, QLD, NSW) with evidence of impact
- **Value**: Aunties can say "Programs like ours reduce recidivism by 30% (NATSILS evidence)"
- **Power**: Funding applications cite national intelligence, not just local anecdotes

**Integration Flow**:
```
JusticeHub Profile → Links to ALMA Intervention
                   → Links to ALMA Evidence
                   → Links to ALMA Outcomes
                   → Generates "Impact Portfolio Score"
```

---

### 2. Community-Owned Infrastructure → ALMA as Knowledge Commons

**JusticeHub Model** (from Mindaroo pitch):
- **9 CORE communities** ($180K annually each)
- **20 NETWORK communities** (free platform access)
- **Indigenous governance** (16 Indigenous staff by Year 3)
- **Community ownership** by Year 5

**ALMA Enhancement**:
- **Shared intelligence base** accessible to all CORE + NETWORK communities
- **Evidence library** validating community-led approaches (not just government sources)
- **Pattern recognition** across communities (learn from each other)
- **Portfolio scoring** showing which programs are underfunded despite strong evidence

**Example Integration**:

**Mparntwe (Alice Springs) CORE Community**:
- **Current**: JusticeHub profile, stories, programs documented
- **With ALMA**:
  - Access to NT youth justice intelligence (11 programs)
  - Evidence from NATSILS + SNAICC (Community Controlled sources)
  - Comparison to QLD's policy tension (learn from other states)
  - Portfolio score showing "high evidence, low funding" programs

**Data Sovereignty**:
- **CORE communities decide**: Which ALMA data appears on their profiles
- **Cultural authority tracked**: Database constraint enforces governance
- **Consent enforcement**: Community Controlled sources marked explicitly

---

### 3. Storytelling System → ALMA Evidence Base

**JusticeHub Innovation** (from STORYTELLING_SYSTEM_README.md):
- **Storytellers own narratives** (copyright + optional NFT)
- **Revenue sharing** when stories generate funding (10% grant citation, 50% media licensing)
- **Literary journalism style** (40%+ direct quotes)
- **Replicable process** with templates

**ALMA Enhancement**:
- **Evidence backing** for story claims (8 evidence records validate program effectiveness)
- **Outcome tracking** for story impact (8 outcome records measure results)
- **National context** for local stories (120 interventions show broader patterns)
- **Portfolio scoring** for storyteller's programs (5-signal framework)

**Example Integration**:

**Aunty Corrine's Story** (JusticeHub case study):
- **Current**: Powerful first-person narrative about cultural mentoring
- **With ALMA**:
  - Links to "Cultural Connection" intervention type (12 programs nationally)
  - Cites SNAICC evidence on family connection outcomes
  - Shows ALMA portfolio score: "High Community Authority (1.0), High Evidence (0.8)"
  - Revenue claim: "Programs like mine reduce recidivism by 30% (citing ALMA evidence)"

**Revenue Impact**:
- **Grant citations**: "This program aligns with evidence from ALMA intelligence" → 10% to storyteller
- **Media licensing**: "Story backed by national youth justice data" → Higher licensing fees
- **Speaking opportunities**: "Evidence-based narrative, not just anecdote" → Premium bookings

---

### 4. Indigenous Knowledge Node → ALMA Community Authority Signal

**JusticeHub Approach** (from strategy docs):
- **CORE/NETWORK model** with paid Indigenous partnerships
- **Cultural protocols** embedded in platform
- **Elder governance frameworks**
- **Advocacy-oriented system challenge**

**ALMA Enhancement**:
- **Community Controlled sources** (NATSILS, SNAICC, ALS NSW)
- **Cultural authority tracking** (database constraint enforces governance)
- **Indigenous outcome tracking** (75% of outcomes from Indigenous sources)
- **Community Authority signal** (30% weight in portfolio scoring—highest!)

**Example Integration**:

**QATSICPP (QLD Peak Body)**:
- **Current**: JusticeHub documents QATSICPP as Indigenous-led organization
- **With ALMA**:
  - 3 Cultural Connection programs documented in QLD
  - Links to SNAICC national evidence (Community Controlled source)
  - Portfolio score: Community Authority = 1.0 (highest possible)
  - Pattern recognition: QATSICPP appointed May 2024, policy tension follows Dec 2024

**Sovereignty Protection**:
- **Database constraint**: Cannot store Community Controlled content without cultural_authority
- **Ethics as code**: Not just policy, but enforced at database level
- **Community ownership**: Indigenous organizations control their intelligence
- **Revenue flow**: When ALMA intelligence generates grants, communities benefit

---

### 5. Place-Based Work → ALMA Context Intelligence

- **Regional patterns** (remote community programs vs metro)
- **National benchmarking** (how does local work compare nationally?)

**Example Integration**:

**Mount Isa Aunties Network**:
- **Current**: JusticeHub documents local Aunties' work
- **With ALMA**:
  - Links to NT "Regional area" contexts (similar remote community work)
  - Compares to NSW "Community-Led" interventions
  - Shows national pattern: "Unpaid cross-system coordination" (common across states)
  - Portfolio score: High Implementation Capability (proven model)

**Strategic Value**:
- **Funding applications**: "Our work aligns with proven models in NT, NSW, QLD"
- **Advocacy**: "National intelligence shows this gap exists everywhere"

**JusticeHub's promise**: "Not creating dependency—building sovereignty"
**ALMA's contribution**: Evidence infrastructure that communities own

**JusticeHub's promise**: "Not extracting knowledge—valuing and compensating"
**ALMA's contribution**: Revenue sharing when intelligence generates funding

**JusticeHub's promise**: "Not another project—permanent infrastructure by Year 5"
**ALMA's contribution**: Sustainable model ($0.80 per update, revenue-generating by Year 2)

**JusticeHub's need**: Credibility with funders (Mindaroo, Paul Ramsay)
**ALMA's answer**: National intelligence, evidence base, Indigenous governance

**JusticeHub's need**: Community engagement and value
**ALMA's answer**: Free profile pages, evidence backing, portfolio scoring

**JusticeHub's need**: Indigenous sovereignty and governance
