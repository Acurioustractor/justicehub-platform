**Current State**: 54 interventions (13 VIC, 39 QLD, 2 Federal)
**Major Gaps**: Evidence, Outcomes, Contexts, NSW, Indigenous-specific sources, Evaluations

---

## CRITICAL GAPS (Highest Priority)

---

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (What to Do Right Now)

### Option A: Complete the Big 3 States ($0.90)
**NSW + NT + More Indigenous sources**
- Covers 80% of Australian youth justice population
- Enables VIC-QLD-NSW-NT comparison
- Strengthens Indigenous intelligence

**Cost**: $0.90
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Priority**: **HIGHEST**

---

### Option B: Evidence First ($2.00)
**AIHW PDFs + Program evaluations + Outcome data**
- Establishes evidence base
- Enables portfolio scoring
- Can assess which programs actually work

**Cost**: $2.00
**Time**: 2 hours
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** (can't score interventions without outcomes)

---

### Option C: Balanced Approach ($2.00)
**NSW programs ($0.50) + AIHW evidence ($1.00) + Indigenous sources ($0.50)**
- Fills biggest state gap
- Starts building evidence base
- Strengthens community authority

**Cost**: $2.00
**Time**: 2 hours
**Priority**: **RECOMMENDED**

---

## WHAT NOT TO FUND YET

❌ **International comparisons** (NZ, Canada, UK) - Nice to have, not critical
❌ **Historical data** (pre-2020) - Focus on current programs first
❌ **Media analysis** - Can do later with sentiment tracking
❌ **Academic theory papers** - Focus on evaluations/outcomes first
❌ **Government submissions** - Too verbose, low signal-to-noise

**Reason**: ALMA needs **current, actionable intelligence** first. Academic/historical context can come later.

---

## RECOMMENDATION: Start with Option C

**Next ingestion** ($2.00, 2 hours):

1. **NSW programs** ($0.50)
   - NSW Department of Communities and Justice
   - NSW Children's Court diversion
   - NSW Aboriginal Legal Service

2. **AIHW evidence PDFs** ($1.00)
   - Youth Justice in Australia 2023-24 (full PDF)
   - Youth detention population 2024
   - Indigenous youth justice data

3. **Indigenous-led sources** ($0.50)
   - NATSILS advocacy reports
   - SNAICC family programs
   - Aboriginal Legal Services (NSW, VIC, QLD)

**Why this sequence?**:
- Fills biggest state gap (NSW)
- Starts evidence base (AIHW)
- Strengthens community authority (Indigenous sources)
- Balanced between breadth (NSW) and depth (evidence)

**After this**, you'll have:
- 100+ interventions across VIC, QLD, NSW
- 20-30 evidence records (starting to validate programs)
- Strong Indigenous intelligence (community authority)

Then move to Phase 2 (full evidence base) or Phase 1 completion (add NT).

---

## Questions for You

1. **Do you want comprehensive state coverage first?** (NSW + NT + SA + WA = all major states)
2. **Or evidence/outcomes first?** (Can assess which programs work, calculate portfolio scores)
3. **Or Indigenous-focused?** (NATSILS, SNAICC, ALS - strengthen community authority)

**My recommendation**: Option C (balanced) gives you the most bang for buck right now.

---

**Total ALMA Investment to Date**: $0.58
**Recommended Next Investment**: $2.00 (Option C)
**Total After Next Phase**: $2.58

**This keeps ALMA sustainably funded while building comprehensive intelligence.**
