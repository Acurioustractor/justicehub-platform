# Sprint 1 Cycle 1 Review Gate

Date: 2026-02-15
Status: Ready for decision lock

## Review Inputs

1. `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/docs/systems/SPRINT_1_VISUAL_PAGE_MAP.md`
2. `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/docs/systems/SPRINT_1_CYCLE_1_PURPOSE_MATRIX.md`
3. `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/docs/systems/LIVE_PAGES_AND_DATA_ALIGNMENT.md`

## Decisions to Lock (Approve / Amend)

1. **Basecamp source of truth**
- Proposed: `/api/basecamps` is canonical for Basecamp surfaces; page fallback arrays are resilience-only.

2. **CoE purpose**
- Proposed: Centre of Excellence converts place-based community proof into national scaling support infrastructure.

3. **Evidence linkage**
- Proposed: Program and intervention evidence claims must resolve through canonical link fields/tables.

4. **Cycle merge gates**
- Proposed: each 48-hour cycle must pass purpose, contract, drift, and basecamp integrity gates before scope expands.

## Acceptance Check for Cycle 1 Sign-off

- Route-family purpose matrix approved.
- Basecamp->CoE chain approved.
- Merge gate checklist approved.
- Cycle 2 scope approved: page ownership labels (`canonical`, `compatibility`, `legacy surface`) across priority pages.

## Next Cycle Preview (Cycle 2)

Output target:
- Page ownership register for priority pages:
  - `/services*`
  - `/community-programs*`
  - `/intelligence*`
  - `/centre-of-excellence*`
  - `/for-community-leaders`
  - `/for-funders`
  - `/admin/data-operations`
  - `/admin/data-health`
