# Sprint 1 Cycle 2 Review Gate

Date: 2026-02-15
Status: Ready for decision lock

## Review Inputs

1. `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/docs/systems/SPRINT_1_CYCLE_2_PAGE_OWNERSHIP.md`
2. `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/docs/systems/SPRINT_1_CYCLE_1_PURPOSE_MATRIX.md`
3. `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/docs/systems/SPRINT_1_VISUAL_PAGE_MAP.md`

## Decisions to Lock (Approve / Amend)

1. Page ownership labels (`canonical`, `compatibility`, `legacy surface`) for all 27 priority pages.
2. Immediate migration priority order:
   - `/community-programs/[id]`
   - `/centre-of-excellence/map`
   - `/intelligence/overview`
3. Naming decision for `/intelligence/programs/[id]` compatibility behavior.
4. Basecamp fallback policy: resilience-only with consistency checks.

## Acceptance Check for Cycle 2 Sign-off

- Ownership labels approved for all priority pages.
- Domain owner assigned for each priority route family.
- Migration priorities approved with scope and acceptance checks.
- Cycle 3 scope approved: page -> API contract ownership and adapter policy.

## Cycle 3 Preview

Output target:
- API contract register for priority page set, including:
  - required fields
  - stability level (`stable`, `compat`, `internal`)
  - canonical source mapping (table/view)
  - breaking-change policy by endpoint
