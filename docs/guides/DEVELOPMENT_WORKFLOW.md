# JusticeHub Development Workflow & Sprint Methodology

## 🌊 **Git Flow Strategy**

### Branch Structure
```
main           # 🟢 Production-ready code (protected, auto-deploy to Vercel)
├── staging    # 🟡 Pre-production testing (deploy to staging.justicehub.com)
├── development # 🔵 Integration branch (all features merge here first)
├── feature/*   # 🟣 Feature branches (feature/user-auth, feature/stories-api)
└── hotfix/*    # 🔴 Emergency production fixes
```

### Workflow Rules
1. **Never commit directly to `main`** - Always use Pull Requests
2. **All features start from `development`** branch
3. **Feature branches** use descriptive names: `feature/supabase-integration`
4. **Daily merges** from `development` → `staging` for testing
5. **Weekly releases** from `staging` → `main` for production

## 🏃‍♂️ **Sprint Methodology: Modified Agile**

### Sprint Structure (1-week sprints)
```
Monday:    Sprint Planning + Feature Branch Creation
Tuesday:   Development Day 1 (deep work)
Wednesday: Development Day 2 + Mid-sprint check
Thursday:  Feature completion + PR creation
Friday:    Code review + Merge to development
Weekend:   Staging deployment + User testing
```

### Sprint Planning Framework

#### **Sprint 1: Real Data Foundation** (Week 1)
**Goal**: Connect live Supabase data and replace all mock content

**User Stories**:
- [ ] As a visitor, I can see real stories from Supabase
- [ ] As a youth, I can create and save stories to the database
- [ ] As a user, I can search real content
- [ ] As an admin, I can manage content through Supabase

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Supabase production database
- [ ] Create database schema for stories, users, organizations
- [ ] Build API routes for CRUD operations
- [ ] Replace mock data in all components
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states

#### **Sprint 2: Authentication & User Management** (Week 2)
**Goal**: Complete user system with roles and permissions

**User Stories**:
- [ ] As a user, I can sign up and log in securely
- [ ] As a youth, I have a personalized dashboard
- [ ] As a mentor, I can access youth stories (with permission)
- [ ] As an org admin, I can manage my organization's users

#### **Sprint 3: Content Management & Gallery** (Week 3)
**Goal**: Rich content creation and cross-linking system

**User Stories**:
- [ ] As a youth, I can upload images/videos with my stories
- [ ] As a visitor, I can browse the interactive gallery
- [ ] As a user, I can discover related content automatically
- [ ] As a content creator, I can tag and categorize my content

## 🛠 **Development Environment Setup**

### Local Development Commands
```bash
# Start development (run these in parallel)
npm run dev          # Next.js development server
supabase start       # Local Supabase instance  
npm run db:studio    # Database GUI

# Quality checks
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation
npm run test         # Unit tests (when added)
```

### Environment Files
```
.env.local           # Local development secrets
.env.development     # Development environment config
.env.staging         # Staging environment config  
.env.production      # Production environment config
```

## 📋 **Sprint Ceremonies**

### Daily (15 minutes)
- **Standup Questions**:
  1. What did I complete yesterday?
  2. What am I working on today?
  3. What blockers do I have?
  4. What do I need help with?

### Weekly Sprint Planning (2 hours)
1. **Sprint Review** (30 min): Demo completed features
2. **Retrospective** (30 min): What went well, what to improve
3. **Sprint Planning** (60 min): Plan next sprint tasks
4. **Technical Debt Review**: Address accumulated tech debt

### Definition of Done
✅ Feature works in development  
✅ Code reviewed and approved  
✅ Tests pass (lint, type-check, build)  
✅ Deployed to staging successfully  
✅ User acceptance testing completed  
✅ Documentation updated  

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### Development Velocity
- **Story Points** completed per sprint
- **Cycle Time**: Feature branch → Production
- **Bug Rate**: Issues found in production
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript errors, lint warnings

### User Engagement (post-launch)
- **Story Creation Rate**: Stories created per week
- **User Retention**: Active users week-over-week
- **Content Discovery**: Gallery interactions
- **Cross-linking Effectiveness**: Related content clicks

## 🚀 **Deployment Pipeline**

### Automatic Deployments
```
Feature Branch → Development Branch → Staging → Production
     ↓              ↓                    ↓         ↓
   PR Created    Auto-deploy         Auto-deploy  Manual
                to dev.site.com    to staging.com  Release
```

### Release Process
1. **Code Freeze**: No new features to staging
2. **User Testing**: Test all user journeys on staging
3. **Performance Check**: Lighthouse, Core Web Vitals
4. **Release Notes**: Document changes for users
5. **Production Deploy**: Merge staging → main
6. **Monitoring**: Watch for errors post-deploy

## 🔧 **Tools & Integrations**

### Development Stack
- **IDE**: VSCode with extensions
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Sentry
