## Action 1: Send Oochiumpa Partnership Email (PRIORITY 1)

**To**: Kristy Bloomfield, Director, Oochiumpa Youth Services
**Subject**: ALMA Integration - Consent Verification & Partnership Proposal

**Email** (from [ABORIGINAL_PARTNERSHIP_OUTREACH.md](ABORIGINAL_PARTNERSHIP_OUTREACH.md:16-92)):

```
Kristy,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm reaching out regarding the integration of Oochiumpa's youth services data into
ALMA (Adaptive Learning for Meaningful Accountability), a new intelligence system
within JusticeHub that centers Aboriginal-owned knowledge.

WHAT WE'VE DONE (with your data):

We've integrated Oochiumpa's outcomes into ALMA as THE FOUNDATION:
✅ 95% reduction in Operation Luna case management (18 of 19 young people)
✅ 72% school re-engagement (from 95% baseline disengagement)
✅ 89% program retention
✅ 71 service referrals completed
✅ 17 youth success stories (referenced from Empathy Ledger, not duplicated)

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Instead of government detention programs being the "default" in youth justice data,
Oochiumpa is now the BENCHMARK. When funders, researchers, or policy makers ask
"what works?", they see your outcomes first.

WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING:

1. **Community Controlled Consent**
   - You own the data (OCAP principles enforced in code)
   - Consent is revocable at any time
   - Permitted uses: JusticeHub platform, Intelligence Packs for Aboriginal orgs,
     funder reports (with your approval)

2. **Revenue Sharing (10%)**
   - Any Intelligence Pack or funder report sales that include Oochiumpa data
   - Revenue flows directly to Oochiumpa
   - Transparent tracking (you'll see exactly how your data is used)

3. **Attribution & Recognition**
   - Every use of Oochiumpa data includes attribution
   - Oochiumpa cited as the Aboriginal-owned benchmark
   - Your model showcased as replication guidance for other communities

4. **Intelligence FOR You**
   - Free Aboriginal Intelligence Pack showing:
     - Oochiumpa's impact in national context
     - Funding gaps and opportunities
     - Replication potential (how other communities could learn from your model)
     - Comparative data (your outcomes vs government programs)

WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU:

✅ Verify consent for the integration we've completed
✅ Permission to use Oochiumpa as an exemplar when reaching out to other
   Aboriginal organizations (NAAJA, APO NT, NATSILS, SNAICC)
✅ Feedback on the consent framework (is 10% revenue share appropriate?
   What else should we include?)

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

If you approve, we'll:
- Week 2: Use Oochiumpa's model (on-country, holistic, Elder-involved) to discover
  similar programs in NT
- Week 3-4: Work with NAAJA/APO NT to document NT programs (using Oochiumpa as benchmark)
- Week 12: Deliver first Aboriginal Intelligence Pack to Oochiumpa, NAAJA, APO NT, NATSILS

This is not extractive data collection. This is partnership. Your intelligence shapes
the system.

Can we schedule a call to discuss?

Best,

## Action 2: Send NAAJA Partnership Email (PRIORITY 2)

**To**: CEO / Youth Justice Program Lead, North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency
**Subject**: NT Youth Justice Intelligence - Oochiumpa as NT Benchmark

**Email** (from [ABORIGINAL_PARTNERSHIP_OUTREACH.md](ABORIGINAL_PARTNERSHIP_OUTREACH.md:276-355)):

```
Dear NAAJA Team,

I'm writing to share a new development in NT youth justice intelligence, and to
explore partnership.

THE NT CONTEXT:

NT has the highest youth detention rate in Australia. 96% of detained youth are
Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander. Royal Commission reports documented systemic
failures, but viable alternatives are rarely highlighted.

THE ALTERNATIVE EXISTS:

Oochiumpa Youth Services (Alice Springs) achieved:
✅ 95% reduction in Operation Luna case management (18 of 19 young people)
✅ 72% school re-engagement
✅ 89% program retention
✅ Aboriginal-owned, on-country experiences, Elder involvement

We've integrated Oochiumpa into ALMA (our intelligence system) as the NT BENCHMARK.

WHAT WE'RE DOING (WEEK 3-4):

NT-focused data gathering using Oochiumpa as the model:
- Government baseline: Royal Commission reports, AIHW data, Productivity Commission
- Discovery: Find programs LIKE Oochiumpa (on-country, holistic, Aboriginal-led)
- Community co-creation: Work WITH NAAJA to document programs, not scrape without permission

WHAT WE NEED FROM NAAJA:

1. **Program Identification**
   - Are there other programs like Oochiumpa in NT?
   - Which Aboriginal-led initiatives should we document?
   - Who are the right contacts?

2. **Community Verification**
   - We'll scrape government sites (public domain)
   - But we want NAAJA to verify: What's missing? What's misrepresented?

3. **Co-Design Intelligence Pack**
   - What would be useful for NAAJA's advocacy work?
   - Funding gaps? Replication guidance? Comparative outcomes?

WHAT WE'RE OFFERING:

1. **Free NT Intelligence Pack** (Week 12 delivery)
   - All NT programs documented (government + community)
   - Oochiumpa as NT success story
   - Gap analysis: What's missing, what's underfunded
   - ROI data: Community alternatives vs detention costs

2. **Policy Advocacy Support**
   - Data for "Raise the Age NT" campaign
   - Comparative analysis (Oochiumpa vs detention outcomes)
   - Replication guidance (how to scale Oochiumpa model)

3. **Revenue Sharing**
   - If NAAJA contributes data/knowledge, 10% revenue share on Intelligence Pack sales
   - Transparent attribution tracking

THE VISION:

By Week 12, NAAJA can walk into a funder meeting and say: "Here's what works
in NT (Oochiumpa + similar programs). Here's what's failing (detention).
Here's the gap (funding). Here's the ask."

Can we schedule a call?

**Timeline**:
- **Send**: Monday, January 6 (morning)
- **Zoom**: Week 2 (schedule on call)

## Action 3: Send APO NT Partnership Email (PRIORITY 3)

**To**: Chair / Policy Coordinator, Aboriginal Peak Organisations NT
**Subject**: NT Aboriginal-Led Programs Intelligence - Partnership Opportunity

**Email** (from [ABORIGINAL_PARTNERSHIP_OUTREACH.md](ABORIGINAL_PARTNERSHIP_OUTREACH.md:360-424)):

```
Dear APO NT Team,

I'm reaching out regarding a new intelligence system (ALMA) that could support
APO NT's advocacy for Aboriginal-led solutions in youth justice.

THE OPPORTUNITY:

We've integrated Oochiumpa Youth Services into ALMA as the NT benchmark:
✅ 95% offending reduction
✅ 72% school re-engagement
✅ Aboriginal-owned, community-controlled

Oochiumpa proves that Aboriginal-led programs work. ALMA makes this visible to funders.

WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING:

**Week 3-4: NT Deep Dive**
- Document 30+ NT youth justice programs
- Balanced approach: 15 government, 15 community (with Oochiumpa as baseline)
- Discover programs undocumented by government
- Community verification (APO NT reviews before database entry)

WHAT WE NEED FROM APO NT:

1. **Member Organisation Connections**
   - APO NT represents Aboriginal organisations across NT
   - Can you facilitate introductions to programs like Oochiumpa?

2. **System-Wide Perspective**
   - What's working in NT (beyond what government reports show)?
   - What's missing (service gaps, funding gaps)?

3. **Intelligence Pack Co-Design**
   - What would be useful for APO NT's advocacy?
   - Focus on remote communities? Youth detention alternatives?

WHAT WE'RE OFFERING:

1. **Free NT Intelligence Pack**
   - Comprehensive mapping of NT programs
   - Oochiumpa outcomes as benchmark
   - Gap analysis FOR Aboriginal orgs (what could be scaled, what's underfunded)

2. **Revenue Model**
   - If APO NT member orgs contribute data, 10% revenue share
   - Attribution tracking (every use documented)

3. **Policy Support**
   - Data for NT-specific advocacy
   - Comparative analysis (Aboriginal-led vs detention)

Can we discuss partnership?

Best,
[Your Name]
ACT Development Team / JusticeHub
```

**Timeline**:
- **Send**: Monday, January 6 (afternoon)
- **Zoom**: Week 2 (schedule on call)
