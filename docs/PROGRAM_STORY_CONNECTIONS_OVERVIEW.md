# Programs ↔ Stories: The Connected System

## Vision

**Every story finds its program. Every program inspires stories.**

JusticeHub creates a living ecosystem where community programs and youth stories naturally interconnect, creating pathways for discovery, inspiration, and real-world impact.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Easy Program Addition 🎯
**Web Form → Database → Live Site**

Anyone can add a program in 5 minutes:
- Navigate to `/community-programs/add`
- Fill intuitive form with guidance
- Click submit
- Program goes live immediately

**No technical knowledge required.**
No CLI, no SQL, no Git commits.

### 2. Natural Story Connections 🔗
**Story → Program → More Stories**

Stories link to programs via simple database relationships:
- Each story can highlight one program
- Each program showcases multiple stories
- Visitors discover both organically

**Visitors find:**
- Programs through compelling stories
- Stories that validate programs
- Related content automatically

### 3. Growing Network Effect 📈
**More Content = Better Discovery**

As content grows, connections multiply:
- 6 programs → 18 stories = 18 connection points
- 20 programs → 60 stories = 60 connection points
- 100 programs → 300 stories = 300 connection points

**Each addition increases value for all content.**

## How It Works

**Adding a Program:**
```
1. Go to /community-programs/add
