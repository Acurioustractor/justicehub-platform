## Email Template for API Access Request

**Subject**: API Access Request - JusticeHub Queensland Youth Justice Directory

**Body**:

Dear Infoxchange Team,

I am reaching out on behalf of **JusticeHub**, a community-driven platform dedicated to connecting young people in Queensland's youth justice system with appropriate support services.

### About JusticeHub

JusticeHub is an open-source, non-profit initiative that aims to create the most comprehensive directory of youth justice services in Queensland. Our mission is to improve outcomes for young people by ensuring they can easily discover and access the services they need.

**Current Status**:
- 403 services in our database
- Focus on Queensland youth justice services
- Growing coverage of mental health, housing, legal aid, cultural support, and more
- Open-source platform built with modern web technologies

### Why We're Reaching Out

We would like to explore access to your **Service Seeker API** to:

1. **Expand our coverage**: Your directory contains thousands of community services that would significantly enhance our offerings
2. **Maintain accuracy**: Access to regularly updated information would ensure our users always have current service details
3. **Fill gaps**: Many Queensland services are likely already in your database, saving us from manual data collection
4. **Build on existing work**: Rather than duplicate efforts, we'd like to build upon your comprehensive directory

### What We're Building

JusticeHub provides:
- **Comprehensive service directory** with advanced filtering (14 specialized categories)
- **Location-based search** to help young people find nearby services
- **Evidence-based content** linking to research and best practices
- **Justice reinvestment focus** connecting to community-led alternatives to incarceration

### Our Ask

We are interested in:
1. **API access** to query Queensland youth justice and support services
2. **Appropriate pricing** for a non-profit community initiative
3. **Partnership opportunities** to contribute back to your platform

### Technical Details

Our platform is built with:
- Next.js 15 (React framework)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
- TypeScript
- Modern web standards

We have experience integrating with external APIs and would implement your API following best practices, including:
- Proper attribution and linking back to Service Seeker
- Rate limiting and responsible usage
- Data caching to minimize API calls
- Regular synchronization schedules

### Community Impact

By integrating with your Service Seeker API, we can:
- **Reach more young people** in need of support
- **Reduce service discovery friction** for youth justice workers
- **Improve service utilization** by better connecting supply with demand
- **Support evidence-based practice** by providing comprehensive options

### Next Steps

We would appreciate the opportunity to:
1. Discuss API access options and pricing
2. Understand integration requirements and documentation
3. Explore how we can contribute back to your platform
4. Schedule a call to discuss partnership opportunities

### Additional Context

Our project is inspired by successful justice reinvestment initiatives across Australia, including:
- Maranguka Justice Reinvestment Project (Bourke, NSW)
- Youth Justice Reform (QLD Government)
- Community-led diversionary programs

We believe that better service discovery is a key enabler of successful justice reinvestment outcomes.

Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to exploring how we can work together to improve outcomes for young people in Queensland's youth justice system.

2. **Complementary not competitive**: You're building on their work, not competing
3. **Proper attribution**: Commit to proper attribution and linking
4. **Technical capability**: Show you can integrate responsibly
5. **Queensland focus**: Specific geographic scope may make this more manageable
6. **Youth justice specialization**: Niche focus rather than general directory

## Potential Pricing Discussion Points

4. **Co-branding**: JusticeHub powered by Infoxchange data
