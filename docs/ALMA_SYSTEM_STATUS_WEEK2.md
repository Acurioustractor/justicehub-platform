## Critical Data Gaps

### 1. Geographic Coverage (MAJOR GAP)

**Current State:**
- ✅ **NT**: 29 programs (comprehensive)
- ⚠️  **SA**: 11 programs (partial)
- ❌ **NSW**: 6 programs (minimal)
- ❌ **VIC**: 0 programs
- ❌ **QLD**: 0 programs
- ❌ **WA**: 0 programs
- ❌ **TAS**: 0 programs
- ❌ **ACT**: 0 programs

**Plan Target (Week 5-6)**: 50 programs per state = **400 total programs**
**Current Total**: 201 programs
**Gap**: 199 programs needed

### 2. Data Quality Gaps

**Websites**: Only 29.4% have websites (142 missing)
**Source Attribution**: Only 29.9% have sources (141 missing)
**Target Cohorts**: Only 40.3% defined (120 missing)
**Evidence Levels**: 75.1% have NULL evidence level (151 programs)

**Why This Matters**: Can't generate Intelligence Packs without outcomes data

### 3. Scraping Infrastructure Gap

**Extraction History**: 0 attempts recorded
**Learning System**: Not operational
**Continuous Ingestion**: Not running

**This means**: All 201 programs were manually created, not scraped. The AI scraping pipeline hasn't been used yet.

---

## What's Working Exceptionally Well

### NT Intelligence Base (GOLD STANDARD)

**Coverage:**
- 16 Aboriginal-led programs (all enriched)
- 13 Government programs (all enriched)
- Perfect geographic spread (Darwin, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Groote, Maningrida, Arnhem Land)

**Outcome Data:**
- Oochiumpa: 95% offending reduction, 72% school re-engagement
- GEBIE GANG: 95% crime reduction, zero youth in detention
- Back on Track: 60% non-reoffending (591 youth 2023)
- Youth Justice Conferencing: 60% non-reoffending

**Aboriginal Leadership:**
- 4 Justice Reinvestment sites ($86.75M total funding)
- 16 Aboriginal Community Controlled Organizations
- Traditional Owner-led programs (Lhere Artepe, Anindilyakwa Land Council)

**This is the model to replicate across all states.**

## Scraping Work Assessment

### What We've Done (Manual Discovery)

**Week 1:**
- Oochiumpa data (23 stories, outcomes, 4 pillars)
- Initial NT government baseline (6 programs)
- Initial Aboriginal programs (3 organizations)

**Week 2:**
- Explore agent research (found 30+ programs via web search)
- Manual enrichment (15 programs enhanced)
- Maningrida discovery (via user suggestion)
- Justice Reinvestment network mapping

**Method**: Human-guided research + Explore agent + manual data entry
**Result**: High-quality, comprehensive NT baseline

### What We Haven't Done (Automated Scraping)

**Not Used:**
- `alma-enhanced-scrape.mjs` - AI extraction from websites
- `alma-learning-system.mjs` - Pattern learning and optimization
- `alma-continuous-ingestion.mjs` - Scheduled automated scraping
- `alma-source-discovery.mjs` - Link following and program discovery

**Why Not**: We've been in "research and establish baseline" mode, not "scale via automation" mode.

### Scraping Capability vs Usage

**We Have:**
- ✅ Firecrawl API integration
- ✅ Claude Sonnet 4.5 extraction
- ✅ Learning system (tracks quality, adapts)
- ✅ Database schema ready for evidence/outcomes
- ✅ Consent framework operational

**We Haven't:**
- ❌ Scraped government websites automatically
- ❌ Extracted from PDF reports (Royal Commissions, AIHW)
- ❌ Followed links to discover hidden programs
- ❌ Built up extraction confidence scores
- ❌ Linked evidence records to interventions

---

## Critical Decision Point: What to Do Next?

### Option 1: Continue NT Partnerships (Plan Week 3-4)

**Do This:**
- Send Oochiumpa partnership email (verify consent, revenue sharing)
- Send NAAJA email (NT Aboriginal organization)
- Send APO NT email (Aboriginal Peak Organisations NT)
- Create Zoom presentation
- Wait for responses, schedule calls

**Pros:**
- Builds trust before scraping other Aboriginal programs
- Oochiumpa call in 2 weeks aligns with this
- Gets feedback on NT Intelligence Brief
- Establishes consent framework

**Cons:**
- Delays multi-state scraping
- Can't build Intelligence Packs without more data
- 201 programs insufficient for portfolio analytics
- Partnership emails may take weeks for responses

**Time to Complete**: 2-4 weeks (waiting for email responses)

### Option 2: Start Multi-State Scraping (Plan Week 5-6)

**Do This:**
- Run `alma-enhanced-scrape.mjs` on NSW, VIC, QLD, SA government sites
- Use learning system to optimize extraction
- AI source discovery to find Aboriginal programs
- Build to 400+ programs across 5 states

**Pros:**
- Builds comprehensive national database quickly
- Enables portfolio analytics and Intelligence Packs
- Tests scraping pipeline at scale
- Creates urgency (more data = more value to show partners)

**Cons:**
- Scraping Aboriginal programs without consent first
- May extract inaccurate data (needs review)
- Doesn't build relationships before data gathering
- Could violate OCAP principles if not careful

**Time to Complete**: 2-3 weeks

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Week 3:**
1. **Send NT partnership emails** (Oochiumpa, NAAJA, APO NT)
2. **Start NSW/VIC/QLD government scraping** (public domain, no consent needed)
3. **Manual Aboriginal program discovery** (identify orgs, don't scrape yet)
4. **NT Intelligence Brief** (share with partners to show value)

**Week 4:**
5. **Continue government scraping** (SA, WA, TAS, ACT)
6. **Evidence linkage** (AIHW, Royal Commission reports)
7. **Aboriginal org outreach** (based on discovered programs)
8. **Oochiumpa call prep** (2 weeks away)

**Week 5-6:**
9. **Aboriginal program enrichment** (with consent from Week 3-4 outreach)
10. **Portfolio analytics** (now have 400+ programs)
11. **Intelligence Pack pilot** (for Oochiumpa + NAAJA)

**Pros:**
- Respects OCAP (Aboriginal programs require consent first)
- Builds database quickly (government = public domain)
- Creates value to show partners (Intelligence Brief)
- Parallel workstreams (partnerships + scraping)

**Time to Complete**: Stays on 12-week plan track

## Conclusion

**We're in a strong position:**
- ✅ NT baseline is comprehensive, high-quality, and balanced
- ✅ Found 2 programs with 95% success rates (Oochiumpa + GEBIE GANG)
- ✅ Frontend is operational and displaying data correctly
- ✅ Database quality is high for NT programs

**Critical path forward:**
- ⚠️  Need to start multi-state scraping (can't build Intelligence Packs with only NT)
- ⚠️  Need to send partnership emails (Oochiumpa call in 2 weeks)
- ⚠️  Need to activate scraping pipeline (manual entry doesn't scale)

**Recommended action**: Hybrid approach - partnerships + government scraping in parallel.

**Next immediate step**: Draft partnership emails and create NT Intelligence Brief to show value.

---

**Status**: Week 2 Complete - Ready for Week 3 Expansion
**Confidence**: High (NT baseline is gold standard, just need to replicate across states)
**Blocker**: None (have all tools, data, and infrastructure ready)
