## Email 1: Oochiumpa Aboriginal Corporation

**To**: info@oochiumpa.org.au (or appropriate contact)
**Subject**: ALMA Youth Justice Partnership - Celebrating Oochiumpa's 95% Success Rate

---

Dear Oochiumpa Team,

I'm reaching out from A Curious Tractor (ACT), a regenerative innovation studio working on ALMA - an Adaptive Learning for Meaningful Accountability system designed to support Aboriginal-led youth justice solutions across Australia.

**Why We're Reaching Out**

Oochiumpa's work is extraordinary. Your 95% reduction in offending and 72% school re-engagement rate represents the gold standard of what's possible when Aboriginal communities lead youth justice responses. We've documented your outcomes as a benchmark program in ALMA, and we believe there's an opportunity to amplify your impact.

**What ALMA Does**

ALMA is a youth justice intelligence system that:
- Documents 624 programs across Australia (134 Aboriginal Community Controlled)
- Links research outcomes to real programs (418 programs with documented outcomes)
- Creates "Intelligence Packs" for funders, policymakers, and communities
- Operates under OCAP principles (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession)
- Highlights what works: Aboriginal-led, community-controlled, on-country programs

**The Opportunity**

We'd love to explore:
1. **Data Sovereignty**: How can ALMA better represent Oochiumpa's model while respecting your data sovereignty?
2. **Outcome Tracking**: Would Oochiumpa be interested in contributing outcome data to demonstrate the power of your approach to funders nationally?
3. **Replication Support**: Could ALMA help document what makes Oochiumpa work so other communities can learn from your model?
4. **Policy Advocacy**: Can we collaborate on showing policymakers that investing in Aboriginal-led programs delivers 95% cost-effectiveness vs $3,320/day detention?

**Our Commitment**

- All Oochiumpa data remains under your control
- Nothing is shared without explicit consent
- We operate under "Community Controlled" consent model
- Revenue from any intelligence products would be shared with contributing communities

**Next Steps**

Would you be open to a 30-minute call in the next two weeks to discuss how we might work together? I'm also happy to visit if that's more appropriate.

With respect for your leadership,

Ben Knight

P.S. We're particularly inspired by your cultural healing approach and on-country programs. The evidence shows this is exactly what young people need - and policymakers need to see it.

## Email 2: North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (NAAJA)

**To**: info@naaja.org.au (or appropriate contact)
**Subject**: ALMA Youth Justice Partnership - Supporting NT Aboriginal Justice

---

Dear NAAJA Team,

I'm reaching out from A Curious Tractor (ACT) regarding ALMA - an Adaptive Learning for Meaningful Accountability system designed to support Aboriginal-led youth justice solutions.

**Why NAAJA Matters**

NAAJA's legal representation and advocacy work is critical to youth justice in the Northern Territory. Your 95% culturally safe legal representation and advocacy for alternatives to detention aligns perfectly with what ALMA is trying to amplify.

**What ALMA Offers**

We've built a database of 624 youth justice programs across Australia, including:
- 29 NT programs (including Aboriginal-led services)
- Documentation of what works: cultural programs, on-country healing, community-controlled services
- Evidence linking Aboriginal-led approaches to better outcomes
- Cost comparisons showing $3,320/day detention vs $150/day community programs

**Partnership Opportunity**

We'd like to explore:
1. **Legal Advocacy Support**: Could ALMA's evidence base support NAAJA's advocacy for reduced detention and increased community programs?
2. **NT Program Mapping**: Help us ensure all NT Aboriginal services are accurately represented
3. **Royal Commission Follow-up**: Track implementation of Royal Commission recommendations
4. **Policy Influence**: Joint submissions showing what works for NT Aboriginal young people

**OCAP Commitment**

ALMA operates under Indigenous data sovereignty principles:
- Aboriginal data remains under Aboriginal control
- Nothing shared without consent
- Community Controlled consent level for Aboriginal organizations
- Revenue sharing with contributing communities

**Next Steps**

Would NAAJA be interested in a brief discussion about how ALMA might support your work? I'm planning to be in Darwin in the coming weeks and would welcome the opportunity to meet.

With respect,

Dear APO NT Team,

I'm writing from A Curious Tractor (ACT) about a potential partnership on youth justice data and advocacy in the Northern Territory.

**About ALMA**

ALMA (Adaptive Learning for Meaningful Accountability) is a youth justice intelligence system designed to:
- Document what works in youth justice (624 programs nationally)
- Amplify Aboriginal-led, community-controlled success stories

**Why APO NT**

As the peak body for Aboriginal organisations in the NT, APO NT is uniquely positioned to:

We currently have:
- 29 NT programs documented
- Including: Oochiumpa, GEBIE GANG, NT Youth Justice services
- Programs like GEBIE GANG showing 95% crime reduction, zero detention
- Evidence base for community vs detention cost comparison

**Partnership Proposal**

We'd like to discuss:
1. **Data Governance**: How should ALMA handle NT Aboriginal data? What governance structures are appropriate?
2. **Program Mapping**: Help us identify all NT Aboriginal youth services
3. **Outcome Documentation**: What outcomes matter to NT communities?
4. **Advocacy Support**: How can ALMA's evidence support APO NT's advocacy?

**Our Commitments**

- Community Controlled consent model
- Nothing shared without explicit consent
- Revenue sharing with contributing communities
