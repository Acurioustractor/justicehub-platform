## 🛠️ Known Issues & Solutions

### 1. Slow Sites Timeout ⚠️
**Issue**: Some sites (e.g., brisyouth.org) timeout at 30s
**Solution**: Increase timeout to 60s or implement retry logic
**Impact**: Low - can skip slow sites

### 2. Claude Model Deprecation Notice
**Issue**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` deprecated (EOL Oct 2025)
**Solution**: Update to latest model when needed
**Impact**: None currently - warning only

### 3. Limited Service Extraction per Page
**Issue**: Claude extracts 1 service per page currently
**Solution**: Enhance prompt to extract ALL services on directory pages
**Impact**: Medium - need to improve extraction for multi-service pages

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Playwright** - Excellent for modern JavaScript sites
2. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Intelligent extraction, understands context
3. **Service Role Key** - Essential for bypassing RLS in scraper
4. **Zod Validation** - Caught data quality issues early
5. **Confidence Scoring** - Helps prioritize manual review

### What Needs Improvement ⚠️
1. **Multi-Service Extraction** - Currently gets 1 service per page
2. **Pagination Handling** - Need to follow "next page" links
3. **Timeout Configuration** - Should be configurable per source
4. **Rate Limiting** - Add delays between requests (be polite)
5. **Deduplication** - Check for duplicate services before inserting

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Run)
1. ✅ Add more working URLs to QLD_SOURCES array
2. ✅ Enhance prompt to extract ALL services from directory pages
3. ✅ Add configurable timeout per source
4. ✅ Implement basic deduplication check

### Short Term (Week 1)
1. Add 10+ more reliable source URLs
2. Implement pagination following for multi-page directories
3. Add retry logic for failed sources
4. Create admin dashboard for reviewing scraped services

### Medium Term (Month 1)
1. Scale to 100+ sources across Queensland
2. Add automated scheduling (cron job for daily/weekly scraping)
3. Implement change detection (re-scrape and update modified services)
4. Add email notifications for scraping failures
