# Session Progress Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Session Goal:** Execute Phase 1 action items from scaling strategy

## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

### 1. Government Provider Scraper ‚úÖ

**What was done:**
- Researched all 43 government-verified service providers from Queensland Department of Youth Justice official list
- Used Claude AI to extract comprehensive information for each provider
- Generated SQL with government verification metadata

**Script created:** [src/scripts/discovery/generate-govt-providers-sql.ts](../src/scripts/discovery/generate-govt-providers-sql.ts)

**SQL file:** [supabase/import-govt-providers.sql](../supabase/import-govt-providers.sql)

**Results:**
- **35 new services added**
- All marked with `government_verified: true` metadata
- Research included: description, website, phone, email, city, categories
- New total: **403 services** (up from 368)

### 2. Data Quality Check ‚úÖ

**Current database metrics:**
- **Total services:** 403 services
- **Website completeness:** 13% (51 services) - improved from 4%
- **Phone completeness:** 10% (41 services)
- **Email completeness:** 5% (22 services)
- **Category quality:** 66% have multiple categories
- **Only 'support' category:** 22% (90 services) - needs improvement

### 3. Queensland Open Data Portal Exploration ‚úÖ

**Finding:** Portal does NOT contain useful service provider data

**Documentation:** [QLD_OPEN_DATA_EXPLORATION.md](QLD_OPEN_DATA_EXPLORATION.md)

**Available datasets:**
- Youth justice referral statistics (not provider info)
- Youth justice centre locations (government facilities only)
- Funding programs (not service directories)

**Conclusion:** Not a viable bulk data source

### 4. Peak Body Research ‚úÖ

**Organizations investigated:**
- **QCOSS** (Queensland Council of Social Service)
  - No public member directory found
  - Would require contacting organization directly

- **YANQ** (Youth Affairs Network Queensland)
  - 880+ individuals and organizations
  - No public member directory
  - Has youth interagency network contacts (not service providers)
  - Interagency page found: https://www.yanq.org.au/youth-interagency-details.html

**Finding:** Peak body directories require direct partnership/contact

## üìä Current Status

### Growth Achievement
- **Started:** 32 services
- **Current:** 403 services
- **Growth:** 1,159% increase

### Data Quality
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total services | 403 | ‚úÖ Good |
| Website coverage | 13% | üî¥ Poor |
| Phone coverage | 10% | üî¥ Poor |
| Multi-category | 66% | ‚úÖ Good |
| Government verified | 35 services | ‚úÖ New |

### Sources Breakdown
- Airtable CSV: 325 organizations
- Government verified list: 35 services
- Justice reinvestment: 11 services
- Original scraping: 32 services

## üéØ Next Priority Actions

Based on today's exploration, the highest-value next steps are:

### Immediate (Can do now)
1. **Improve categories for 90 services** with only 'support' category
   - Script ready: `improve-service-categories.ts`
   - Est. time: 30 minutes

### Short-term (Requires external action)
2. **Contact Infoxchange for Service Seeker API access**
   - Potential: +2,000-5,000 services
   - Email: partnerships@infoxchange.org
   - Highest ROI data source identified

3. **Contact QCOSS for member directory**
   - Potential: +100-300 services
   - Phone: (07) 3004 6900
   - Hours: 8:30am-5pm Mon-Fri

4. **Contact YANQ for member info**
   - 880+ member organizations
   - Could provide significant coverage

### Medium-term (Requires development)
5. **Google Places API integration**
   - Search for "youth services" by Queensland region
   - Potential: +300-800 services
   - Cost: $350-850/month

6. **AI-powered discovery pipeline**
   - Use Claude/Perplexity to research specific service types
   - Target categories with low coverage
   - Potential: +500-1,500 services

## üìÅ Files Created This Session

1. [`/src/scripts/discovery/scrape-govt-providers.ts`](../src/scripts/discovery/scrape-govt-providers.ts) - Playwright-based scraper (hit page structure issue)
2. [`/src/scripts/discovery/import-govt-providers.ts`](../src/scripts/discovery/import-govt-providers.ts) - Direct import script (hit RLS errors)
3. [`/src/scripts/discovery/generate-govt-providers-sql.ts`](../src/scripts/discovery/generate-govt-providers-sql.ts) - **Working solution** - SQL generator
4. [`/supabase/import-govt-providers.sql`](../supabase/import-govt-providers.sql) - Generated SQL (successfully executed)
5. [`/docs/QLD_OPEN_DATA_EXPLORATION.md`](QLD_OPEN_DATA_EXPLORATION.md) - Research findings
6. This file - Session summary

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Direct SQL generation is more reliable than TypeScript imports** when dealing with RLS policies
2. **Government sources provide high-quality verified data** - prioritize these
3. **Open data portals have limited service provider info** - statistics and reports, not directories
4. **Peak body directories are not publicly accessible** - requires partnerships
5. **AI research works well for individual organizations** - 100% success rate on 43 providers

## üöÄ Recommended Next Step

**Priority 1:** Contact Infoxchange for Service Seeker API access
- Highest potential impact (+2,000-5,000 services)
- Professional, verified data
- Could 5-10x current database size
- Email: partnerships@infoxchange.org

**Alternative if waiting on external contacts:** Run category improvement script to enhance existing 403 services
