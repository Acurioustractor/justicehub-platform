# Week 2 Action Plan
## Oochiumpa Pattern Learning & NT Discovery

**Week**: 2 of 12
**Dates**: January 5-11, 2026
**Status**: 🚀 IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Use Oochiumpa patterns to discover 5-10 similar Aboriginal-led programs in NT

---

## What We're Building This Week

### The Strategy

Week 1 established **Oochiumpa as the foundation** (Aboriginal-owned intelligence, 95% offending reduction, 72% school re-engagement).

Week 2 uses **Oochiumpa as the pattern** to discover similar programs across NT that government doesn't document.

**Not**: "Scrape everything and see what we find"
**Yes**: "Learn from Oochiumpa's model and find programs that work the same way"

---

## Three Parallel Tracks

### Track 1: AI-Powered Source Discovery (30% of effort)

**Goal**: Find 5-10 programs similar to Oochiumpa using AI pattern matching

**Process**:
1. ✅ Extract Oochiumpa patterns (keywords, outcomes, structure)
2. 🔄 Analyze NT Aboriginal organization websites (NAAJA, APO NT, AMSANT, CAFS)
3. ⏳ Score program similarity (0-100 scale)
4. ⏳ Identify "Very Similar" programs (80+ score)
5. ⏳ Output: List of 5-10 programs for partnership outreach

**Current Status**: AI discovery running in background

**Seed URLs**:
- NAAJA (North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency)
- APO NT (Aboriginal Peak Organisations NT)
- AMSANT (Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT)
- CAFS (Central Australian Family Services)

**Expected Output**:
```
Programs Discovered: 10-15
  - Very Similar to Oochiumpa: 5-7 programs
  - Similar: 3-5 programs
  - Organizations Identified: 8-12
  - New Sources to Explore: 20-30 links
```

### Track 2: Government Baseline Scraping (30% of effort)

**Goal**: Document 30+ NT government sources for comparison to Oochiumpa

**Sources to Scrape**:

**Federal**:
- AIHW Youth Justice 2023-24 Report
- Productivity Commission ROGS 2025 (Youth Justice chapter)
- Attorney-General Department - Youth Justice Strategy

**NT Government**:
- Royal Commission into Protection & Detention of Children in NT (2017)
- NT Youth Justice Act reviews
- Territory Families annual reports (2020-2024)
- Don Dale Youth Detention Centre reports

**Academic**:
- Menzies School of Health Research (Youth wellbeing studies)
- Charles Darwin University (Indigenous research)

**Process**:
1. Use Firecrawl API to scrape PDFs/HTML
2. Claude extracts interventions, outcomes, costs
3. Store in ALMA database
4. Flag: Which programs are detention-focused? (High Harm Risk)
5. Compare: Government-documented vs Oochiumpa-style community programs

**Expected Output**:
- 30+ government sources documented
- 15+ government interventions extracted
- Comparison: Oochiumpa (95% success, $X cost) vs detention (40% re-offending, $XXX,000 cost)

## Success Metrics (Week 2)

### Must-Have (Critical)
- ✅ **AI discovery complete**: 5-10 programs similar to Oochiumpa identified
- ✅ **Oochiumpa consent verified**: Partnership agreement signed or in-progress
- ✅ **2+ partnerships initiated**: NAAJA + APO NT (or NATSILS/SNAICC)
- ✅ **NT government baseline**: 30+ sources documented

### Nice-to-Have (Stretch Goals)
- 4+ partnerships initiated (all 4 orgs respond positively)
- Consent framework endorsed by NATSILS/SNAICC
- 10+ programs discovered via AI (exceed 5-10 target)
- Government comparison complete (Oochiumpa vs detention ROI calculated)

### Blockers to Watch
- **Low response rate**: If Aboriginal orgs don't respond to emails
  - Mitigation: Phone calls, leverage existing ACT relationships
- **AI discovery yields few results**: If seed URLs don't have program info
  - Mitigation: Add more NT Aboriginal org websites, go 2-3 levels deep
- **Government data inaccessible**: If PDFs are scanned images (not text)
  - Mitigation: Manual extraction for key documents, OCR if needed

## Week 2 → Week 3 Handoff

### What We'll Have by End of Week 2

**Intelligence**:
- 5-10 Aboriginal-led programs discovered (similar to Oochiumpa)
- 30+ government sources documented
- Comparison: Community vs government outcomes

**Partnerships**:
- Oochiumpa consent verified
- 2+ Aboriginal org partnerships initiated
- Consent framework reviewed (NATSILS/SNAICC input)

**Tools**:
- AI discovery operational (can scale to other states in Week 5-6)
- Government scraping pipeline working
- Zoom presentation proven (if calls go well)

### What Week 3-4 Will Do

**NT Comprehensive Mapping** (30+ programs, community-verified):
- Work WITH NAAJA/APO NT to document programs (not scrape without permission)
- Community co-creation: They identify programs, we document with their guidance
- Cross-reference: AI-discovered + government-documented + community-verified
- Gap analysis FOR Aboriginal orgs: What's missing, what could be replicated from Oochiumpa
- NT Intelligence Brief: First test of Intelligence Pack (shared with Oochiumpa, NAAJA, APO NT)

---

## Critical Path

### Week 2 Success Depends On:

1. **Oochiumpa responds positively**
   - If yes: We have permission to use as exemplar for other orgs
   - If no/unsure: We pause, address concerns, don't proceed without consent

2. **At least 2 Aboriginal orgs engage** (NAAJA + APO NT ideal)
   - If yes: Week 3-4 co-creation possible
   - If no: We focus on government baseline, try different outreach approach

3. **AI discovery finds programs** (5-10 target)
   - If yes: Week 3-4 has contact list for partnership
   - If no: Manual discovery, ask Aboriginal orgs "who's doing work like Oochiumpa?"

**If all 3 succeed**: Week 2 is a **GO** for Week 3-4 NT comprehensive mapping

**If 1-2 succeed**: Week 2 is **PARTIAL**, adjust Week 3-4 accordingly

**If 0 succeed**: Week 2 is **BLOCKED**, pause and reassess strategy

---

## Week 2 Philosophy

### What We're NOT Doing

❌ Scraping Aboriginal org websites without asking
❌ Documenting programs without community verification
❌ Moving forward if Oochiumpa doesn't approve
❌ Extractive research (take data, provide nothing in return)

### What We ARE Doing

✅ Learning from Oochiumpa's model (pattern recognition)
✅ Reaching out WITH permission (show Oochiumpa as exemplar)
✅ Offering value first (free Intelligence Pack, revenue sharing)
✅ Building relationships (not just collecting data)

### The Test

**Before any action, ask**:
- "Would Oochiumpa approve of this?"
- "Does this serve Aboriginal communities or extract from them?"
- "Are we centering Aboriginal intelligence or marginalizing it?"

If the answer is unclear, pause and ask.
