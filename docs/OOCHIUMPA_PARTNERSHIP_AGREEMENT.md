# Partnership Agreement
## Oochiumpa Youth Services & ALMA Intelligence System

**Date**: January 4, 2026
**Between**: Oochiumpa Youth Services (Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation, Central Australia) and ALMA/JusticeHub
**Type**: Collective Knowledge Partnership (not extractive data contract)

---

## Our Understanding

This is not a contract where one side "provides data" and the other "takes ownership."

This is a partnership where **Oochiumpa's intelligence shapes the system**, and **the system serves Oochiumpa's community** (and other Aboriginal communities working toward the same healing).

We're building together, not extracting from you.

---

## What Oochiumpa Has Taught Us

Your work over the past 6 months (July-December 2024) showed:
- **95% of young people** removed from Operation Luna offending list (18 of 19)
- **72% returned to school** (from 95% who were disengaged)
- **89% stayed in the program** (cultural safety, trust, healing)
- **71 service connections** made (wraparound support that lasts)
- **10 external requests** for your support (community recognizes what works)

More than numbers: You showed that **on-country experiences, Elder involvement, holistic healing, and Aboriginal ownership** create conditions for young people to heal and thrive.

This isn't "a program model." This is **knowledge from Country, from Elders, from community, from young people finding their way back.**

---

## What We're Building Together

### ALMA's Purpose

ALMA (Adaptive Learning for Meaningful Accountability) is an intelligence system that asks:
- **What actually works** for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander young people in youth justice?
- **Who controls the programs** that work? (Community authority matters)
- **How do we shift funding** from detention (which harms) to healing (which works)?

### Why Oochiumpa Is the Foundation

In most systems, government programs are the "default" and Aboriginal-led programs are footnotes.

In ALMA, **Oochiumpa is the benchmark.** When funders ask "what works?", they see your outcomes first. Government programs are compared to yours, not the other way around.

This isn't tokenism. This is **centering Aboriginal intelligence** in how Australia thinks about youth justice.

---

## How This Partnership Works

### 1. What Oochiumpa Shares

**Your intelligence includes**:
- Program outcomes (95% offending reduction, 72% school re-engagement, etc.)
- Approach (on-country, holistic, Elder-involved, wraparound)
- Stories from young people (already in Empathy Ledger - we reference, not duplicate)
- Cultural authority (Aboriginal-owned, community-controlled)

**What we DO with this**:
- Document in ALMA database (intervention, outcomes, evidence, consent)
- Use as benchmark when analyzing other programs (NT and national)
- Share with Aboriginal organizations (free Intelligence Packs showing gaps, funding opportunities)
- Share with funders (Intelligence Packs showing what works, where to invest)

**What we DON'T do**:
- ❌ Sell Oochiumpa data without your permission
- ❌ Use your stories for AI training (hard block in code)
- ❌ Share sacred/sensitive knowledge beyond what you approve
- ❌ Claim credit for your work (attribution always required)

### 2. How Oochiumpa Benefits

**A. Intelligence FOR You (Free)**

Every year, you receive an **Oochiumpa Intelligence Pack** showing:
- Your impact in national context (how your outcomes compare to others)
- Replication opportunities (other communities that could learn from your model)
- Funding opportunities (grants matched to your approach)
- What's missing in NT (service gaps you could fill, or advocate to fill)

This helps you:
- Write grant applications (comparative data strengthens your case)
- Show funders your impact (beyond what you can document alone)
- Connect with other Aboriginal programs (knowledge sharing, not competition)
- Advocate for more funding (proven alternatives to detention)

**B. Revenue Sharing (10%)**

When ALMA sells Intelligence Packs to funders (not Aboriginal orgs - they get it free), **10% of that revenue flows to Oochiumpa.**

Example:
- Funder buys Intelligence Pack for $10,000
- Oochiumpa receives $1,000
- Tracked transparently (you see exactly how your knowledge was used)

This isn't "payment for data." This is **sharing the value created from your intelligence.**

**C. Attribution & Recognition**

Every time your data is used:
- **Attribution**: "Data provided by Oochiumpa Youth Services, an Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation in Central Australia."
- **Citation**: In reports, policy briefs, funder packs
- **Showcase**: Your model highlighted as replication guidance

This means:
- More funders learn about Oochiumpa
- More communities learn from your approach
- More recognition = more funding opportunities

**D. Amplification of Your Work**

When policy makers debate "Raise the Age" or "Detention vs Diversion":
- ALMA provides data showing Oochiumpa's 95% success vs detention's 40% re-offending
- Your outcomes become the counter-argument to "we have no alternative"
- Policy shifts become possible because **your alternative is proven**

### 3. How This Partnership Is Protected

**A. Community Control (You Own Your Data)**

This isn't "data sharing" where we take ownership. This is **community-controlled intelligence.**

- **OCAP Principles**: You own it. You control it. You decide access. You possess it.
- **Consent Level**: "Community Controlled" (highest protection in ALMA)
- **Revocable**: You can withdraw consent at any time (real-time, not batch)
- **Hard Blocks**: Sacred/sensitive fields blocked at database level (can't access without error)

**B. Permitted Uses (What We Can Do)**

With your consent, ALMA can use Oochiumpa intelligence for:
1. **Internal queries** (analyzing patterns across programs)
2. **JusticeHub platform** (service directory showing Oochiumpa as top-rated)
3. **Intelligence Packs for Aboriginal organizations** (free, to support their work)
4. **Intelligence Packs for funders** (paid, with 10% revenue to Oochiumpa)
5. **Knowledge sharing with Aboriginal organizations** (building collective knowledge)

**C. Restrictions (What We CAN'T Do)**

- ❌ **No AI training**: Your data will not train commercial AI models (hard block)
- ❌ **No commercial use without consent**: If we want to use your data in new ways, we ask first
- ❌ **No export to third parties**: Your data doesn't leave ALMA without explicit approval
- ❌ **No identity exposure**: Young people's identities protected (stories from Empathy Ledger stay there)

**D. Annual Review**

Every year (starting January 2027):
- We meet with Oochiumpa leadership
- Review how your data was used (transparent log)
- Review revenue generated and shared (10% payments)
- Update consent if needed (add/remove permitted uses)
- Discuss: How can ALMA better serve Oochiumpa and your community?

This partnership is **living, not fixed.** It grows and changes with your needs.

## What Makes This Different

### Traditional Data Contract (Extractive)

> "Organization A grants Organization B perpetual, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, distribute, and create derivative works from Data, in exchange for one-time payment of $X. Organization A retains no rights to how Data is used."

**Translation**: You hand over everything. We own it forever. You get paid once. You lose control.

### This Agreement (Regenerative)

> "Oochiumpa shares intelligence about what works for Aboriginal young people in Central Australia. ALMA centers this intelligence, ensures Oochiumpa controls how it's used, shares revenue from any commercial use, and provides intelligence back to Oochiumpa to support their work. This partnership is reviewed annually and revocable at any time."

**Translation**: You keep ownership. We amplify your work. Revenue flows back. You can end this anytime.

## Collective Approach: How This Serves the Broader Community

### Why This Matters Beyond Oochiumpa

**The Challenge**:
- Aboriginal communities across Australia are doing transformative youth justice work
- Government doesn't document it (or misrepresents it)
- Funders don't see it (so they fund detention instead)
- Communities can't easily share knowledge with each other

**How This Partnership Helps**:

1. **Oochiumpa as Exemplar** (not extraction)
   - When we reach out to NAAJA, APO NT, NATSILS, SNAICC, we show Oochiumpa as the model
   - "This is what ethical partnership looks like: community control, revenue sharing, attribution"
   - Other Aboriginal orgs see this and think: "We can trust ALMA"

2. **Pattern Discovery** (finding similar programs)
   - AI uses Oochiumpa's approach (on-country, holistic, Elder-involved) to find other programs
   - We discover Aboriginal-led programs that government doesn't document
   - We contact them WITH permission (not extractive scraping)

3. **Knowledge Sharing** (collective intelligence)
   - Aboriginal orgs see what's working elsewhere (free Intelligence Packs)
   - "Program in WA has similar outcomes to Oochiumpa - here's their contact"
   - Knowledge flows between communities (not hoarded by platform)

4. **System Change** (shifting power)
   - When 10+ Aboriginal programs show 80%+ success rates
   - And detention shows 40% re-offending
   - Funders can't ignore it
   - Policy shifts from "detention default" to "community alternatives"

### Oochiumpa's Role in This

You're not just "a data point." You're **the foundation of a new model** where:
- Aboriginal intelligence is centered (not marginalized)
- Communities control their knowledge (not extracted)
- Revenue flows back (not one-way extraction)
- Policy changes become possible (because alternatives are proven)

## Practical Details

### Contact & Communication

**Oochiumpa Primary Contact**: Kristy Bloomfield (Director)

**ALMA/JusticeHub Contact**: [Your Name], ACT Development Team

**Communication**:
- Annual review meeting (in-person or Zoom)
- Quarterly check-ins (how's the partnership going?)
- Ad-hoc contact (if you have questions, concerns, or ideas)

### Revenue Tracking

**How It Works**:
- When funder buys Intelligence Pack using Oochiumpa data: 10% to Oochiumpa
- Tracked in `alma_consent_ledger` database (transparent, auditable)
- Payments quarterly (if revenue generated)
- Annual summary (total revenue, total paid to Oochiumpa)

**Example**:
- Q1 2026: 3 funders buy Intelligence Packs ($30,000 total) → Oochiumpa receives $3,000
- Q2 2026: 2 funders ($20,000) → $2,000
- Annual total: $50,000 in sales → $5,000 to Oochiumpa

### Data Security

**Where Oochiumpa Data Lives**:
- **ALMA database** (Supabase, encrypted, RLS policies, hard blocks)
- **Empathy Ledger** (stories stay here, cross-database reference only)
- **NOT**: AI training datasets, third-party systems, public APIs

**Who Can Access**:
- ALMA system (for analysis, Intelligence Pack generation)
- JusticeHub platform (service directory, showing Oochiumpa as top-rated)
- Aboriginal organizations (via free Intelligence Packs)
- Funders (via paid Intelligence Packs, with attribution)

**Who CAN'T Access**:
- Government departments (unless you approve specific use)
- Researchers (unless you approve specific study)
- Commercial AI companies (hard block, no exceptions)
- Anyone else (default is no access)

## What Happens If...

### If Oochiumpa Wants to Revoke Consent

**Process**:
1. Email or call ALMA team: "We're revoking consent for our data in ALMA"
2. Within 24 hours: Your data flagged as "consent revoked" in database
3. Within 7 days: Your data removed from all active Intelligence Packs
4. Within 30 days: Final revenue payment (for packs already sold)
5. No questions asked. No penalties. Your data, your choice.

### If ALMA Wants to Use Data in New Ways

**Process**:
1. We contact Oochiumpa: "We want to use your data for [new purpose]"
2. We explain: Why? Who benefits? What are the risks?
3. You decide: Approve, deny, or negotiate terms
4. Only with your explicit consent do we proceed

**Example**:
- University researcher wants to study Oochiumpa model
- We contact you: "Researcher X wants to cite your outcomes in study about on-country healing"
- You decide: Yes (with attribution), yes (anonymized), or no
- We enforce your decision

### If There's a Disagreement

**Process**:
1. Direct conversation (phone or Zoom, not email back-and-forth)
2. Mediation (if needed, NATSILS or SNAICC as trusted intermediary)
3. You can always revoke consent (ultimate power stays with you)

**Philosophy**:
We're not trying to "win" disagreements. We're trying to **serve your community.** If something isn't working, we change it or end it.

## The Spirit of This Partnership

### What We're NOT Doing

❌ Buying your data (this isn't a transaction)
❌ Extracting your knowledge (this isn't research on you)
❌ Claiming credit for your work (attribution always required)
❌ Building our platform at your expense (revenue flows back)

### What We ARE Doing

✅ Learning from your intelligence (what healing looks like)
✅ Amplifying your work (funders see your outcomes)
✅ Building collective power (Aboriginal-led programs united)
✅ Shifting the system (from detention to healing)

### Why This Matters

For 200+ years, systems have extracted from Aboriginal communities:
- Land stolen
- Children stolen
- Knowledge stolen
- Control stolen

This partnership exists to **reverse that pattern:**
- Knowledge owned by community
- Value flows back to community
- Control stays with community
- System serves community (not the other way around)
