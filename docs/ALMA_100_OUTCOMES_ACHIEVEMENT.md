## What This Means for ALMA

### **Immediate Value**
1. **Evidence Base**: 16.2% of database now has documented outcomes - enough for credible Intelligence Packs
2. **Aboriginal Voice**: 44 Aboriginal programs with outcomes demonstrates community-led success
3. **Benchmark Programs**: Oochiumpa (95%), GEBIE GANG (95%), Maranguka (23%) provide gold standard comparisons
4. **State Coverage**: All states represented with evidence-backed programs

### **Intelligence Pack Readiness**
- **For Funders**: Can show what works, where gaps exist, compare approaches
- **For Aboriginal Organizations**: Can demonstrate proven Aboriginal-led models (44 examples)
- **For Policymakers**: Can identify effective alternatives to detention
- **For Researchers**: Can identify programs needing evaluation support

### **Next Phase Opportunities**
1. **Deepen Outcomes**: Link AIHW Youth Justice reports to remaining programs
2. **Academic Partnerships**: Connect researchers to unevaluated programs
3. **Community Co-Creation**: Work with Aboriginal organizations to document community-defined outcomes
4. **Longitudinal Tracking**: Begin tracking program changes over time

---

## Evidence Gaps & Next Steps

### **Programs Still Needing Outcomes** (523/624 = 83.8%)
- **Priority 1**: Major NGOs without outcomes (Centacare, St Vincent de Paul, etc.)
- **Priority 2**: Aboriginal organizations without evaluation data
- **Priority 3**: QLD programs from CSV (325 programs, most unevaluated)
- **Priority 4**: Government programs with published reports we haven't linked yet

### **Research Opportunities**
1. **NT Programs**: Link Royal Commission outcomes data to NT programs
2. **Aboriginal Programs**: Community-led evaluation framework for 90 Aboriginal programs without outcomes
3. **QLD Programs**: Match to AIHW Youth Justice reports for QLD data
4. **Regional Programs**: Document community-reported outcomes where formal research doesn't exist

### **Evidence Linkage Targets**
- **Phase 1** (COMPLETE): 100+ programs with outcomes (16%)
- **Phase 2** (Target): 200 programs with outcomes (32%)
- **Phase 3** (Goal): 300+ programs with outcomes (48%)
