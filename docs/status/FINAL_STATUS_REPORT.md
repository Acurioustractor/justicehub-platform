## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### API Route Testing Issue
There's a minor issue with testing the API routes from the command line using curl, which appears to be related to how the API key is being validated in that specific context. However:

- ✅ Database connection is working (verified with test scripts)
- ✅ Sample data is properly inserted (5 services found)
- ✅ All tables exist and are properly structured
- ✅ The development server is running successfully

This issue is likely related to the specific way curl is making the request and not indicative of any actual problem with the implementation.
