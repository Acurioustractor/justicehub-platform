## 🔧 Solution: Wait for Schema Cache Refresh

### Option 1: Automatic Refresh (Recommended)
**⏱️ Wait 10-15 minutes**
- Supabase schema cache typically refreshes automatically every 10-15 minutes
- No action required on your part
- After refresh, all operations will work normally

### Option 2: Force Refresh
**🔄 Restart Development Server**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd /Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Manual Cache Reset
**⚡ Contact Supabase Support**
- If the issue persists beyond 30 minutes
- Request manual schema cache refresh
- Provide project ID: tednluwflfhxyucgwigh

## 🚀 What You Can Do Right Now

### 1. **Verify API Keys**
Make sure your real API keys are in `.env.local`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-real-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-real-anthropic-key
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-your-real-firecrawl-key
```

### 2. **Test External Services**
Verify your API keys work with external services:
```bash
# Test Firecrawl
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIRECRAWL_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://httpbin.org/html"}'

# Test OpenAI
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"
```

### 3. **Monitor Database**
Continue to verify database access works:
```bash
cd /Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub
npx tsx src/scripts/manual-inspection.ts
```

## 🎯 When Schema Cache Refreshes

### The AI Scraper Will:
1. **✅ Create Processing Jobs**: INSERT into processing_jobs table
2. **✅ Start Scraping**: Use Firecrawl to scrape government websites
3. **✅ Extract Data**: Use AI to parse service information
4. **✅ Populate Database**: Add new services to scraped_services table
5. **✅ Enrich Organizations**: Add data to organization_enrichment table
6. **✅ Update Metadata**: Log scraping activity in scraping_metadata table

### You'll See:
- New records appearing in processing_jobs
- Services being discovered from government sources
- Organization data being enriched
- Your Service Finder automatically growing with real data
