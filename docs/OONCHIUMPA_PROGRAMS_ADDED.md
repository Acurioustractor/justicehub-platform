## Next Steps

### 1. Link Kristy Bloomfield Correctly

Kristy is **NOT a participant** - she's the **Program Leader/Founder** of Oonchiumpa.

**To link her correctly:**

```bash
# Link Kristy as Program Leader to the main Youth Support Program
npx tsx src/scripts/manage-programs.ts link \
  "b59a1f4c-94fd-4805-a2c5-cac0922133e0" \
  "7a7e92fc-a7d0-4c0d-a984-e935e22b25a3" \
  "Program Founder & Director" \
  "Kristy Bloomfield leads Oonchiumpa's vision to achieve economic self-determination and transform youth justice through cultural approaches" \
  true
```

### 2. Link Actual Participant Stories

Review Kristy's 17 stories in Empathy Ledger:
- Stories like "M: From Homelessness to Independent Living"
- "A: From Guarded and Disengaged to Articulate Self-Advocate"
- "J: Building Confidence to Seek Support Independently"

These are stories Kristy has **documented about** participants. If those participants have their own profiles in Empathy Ledger, link THEM as "Program Participant".

### 3. View on Website

You should now see **11 total programs** (6 original + 5 Oonchiumpa programs).

## Notes on Profile Linkages

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Kristy Bloomfield's stories in Empathy Ledger are **about** program participants, not her own personal story. She should be linked as:
- ‚úÖ "Program Founder" or "Program Director"
- ‚úÖ "Organization Leader"
- ‚ùå NOT as "Program Participant"
- ‚ùå NOT as "success story" or "mental health outcomes"

The actual young people whose stories she's documenting (M, A, J, MS, etc.) should be the ones linked as participants - IF they have their own profiles in Empathy Ledger.
