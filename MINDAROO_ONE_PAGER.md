# JusticeHub: Community-Owned Knowledge Platform for Youth Justice
## One-Page Strategic Overview for Mindaroo Foundation

---

### THE PROBLEM: Communities Trapped in Dependency Cycles

Indigenous communities have developed effective youth justice approaches, but remain trapped in philanthropic dependency—spending **30-40% of time writing grants**[^1], having programmes shut down when funding ends, and seeing their knowledge extracted without compensation. The sector wastes **$5M+ annually** reinventing solutions that already exist but remain invisible.

---

### OUR SOLUTION: Economic Self-Determination Through Community Ownership

JusticeHub creates **community-owned** digital infrastructure (not just "community-led") that **breaks philanthropic dependency** through revenue generation and capacity building. This is **seed capital for permanent infrastructure**, not ongoing programme funding.

**What Makes This Different:**
- ✅ **Costs reduce over time** (20-26% by Year 3) through community capacity building
- ✅ **Young Indigenous people** trained and employed as developers/producers
- ✅ **Revenue generation** built in ($50-500K by Year 3 depending on level)
- ✅ **Legal ownership** transfers to community-governed ACCO by Year 5
- ✅ **Time-limited partnership** (3-5 years), not perpetual dependency

### HOW IT WORKS: The Capacity Building Model

**Year 1:** External staff + Indigenous trainees → Platform development + training
**Year 2:** Trainees advancing, community members training → Costs starting to reduce
**Year 3:** Indigenous developers **leading** technical work → **20-26% cost savings**, revenue generating

---

### THREE IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS

| Level | Investment | Communities | Key Features | Cost Reduction | Sustainability |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **1: Minimal** | **$4-5.6M** | 3-5 | Basic platform, 2-3 trainees, international learning | 15-20% by Year 3 | Foundation proven |
| **2: Foundational** ⭐ | **$7.5-10.5M** | 6 | Deep engagement, 4-5 trainees, National Forums, international best-practice | 20% by Year 3 | 60-70% by Year 5 |
| **3: Comprehensive** | **$13-17M** | 10 | Infrastructure grants, 6-8 trainees, Global Forum, media/arts campaign | 26% by Year 3 | 75-85% by Year 5 |

---

### RECOMMENDED: LEVEL 2 - FOUNDATIONAL EXCELLENCE | $7.5M - $10.5M

**The Investment:**
- **Year 1:** $2.0M - $2.8M → Foundation: 6 communities, platform, team, training begins
- **Year 2:** $2.5M - $3.5M → Growth: Cost efficiencies beginning, National Forum, international exchange *(subject to Year 1 evidence)*
- **Year 3:** $2.8M - $4.0M → Scale: 20% cost reduction evident, revenue $50-100K, Governance Board operational *(subject to progress)*

**What $7.5M - $10.5M Achieves (3 Years):**
- **300+ programmes** documented with community-owned implementation guides
- **4-5 young Indigenous developers/producers** trained and employed (formerly trainees)
- **15-20 community members** trained in content creation, platform management, data collection
- **20% staff cost reduction** ($256K annual savings) through community capacity
- **2 National Forums** + 8 regional workshops delivered
- **International connections** (NZ, Canada) positioning Australia as regional leader
- **Revenue generation:** $50-100K by Year 3, growing to $400-600K by Year 5
- **Community Governance Board** operational and transitioning to full ownership
- **60-70% financially self-sustaining by Year 5**

### STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT WITH MINDAROO

**Youth Justice AND Early Childhood Prevention:**
- **Intergenerational trauma prevention:** Supporting youth today prevents trauma for tomorrow's 0-5 year olds
- **Longitudinal evidence:** Track which 0-5 programmes prevent later justice involvement
- **Prevention ROI:** Platform enables cost-benefit analysis for early intervention

**But also:** Youth justice communities need this infrastructure regardless of 0-5 linkages. The project stands on its own merit—the early childhood connection is a **strategic bonus**, not the foundation.

### IMPACT: WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**For Communities:** Legal ownership, young people employed, revenue generated, no more grant dependency
**For the Sector:** Access to proven programmes, $5M+ annual savings from reduced duplication, better outcomes
**For Mindaroo:** Leadership in transformational philanthropy, community ownership model proven, impact multiplying beyond investment
**For Young People:** Services based on what works, pathways from recipients to platform developers and leaders

---

### SUSTAINABILITY: BREAKING PHILANTHROPIC DEPENDENCY

**Revenue Streams:** Organisational memberships, government training contracts, premium content/consulting
**Financial Trajectory (Level 2):**
- Year 3: $50-100K revenue, 20% cost reduction
- Year 4: $200-300K revenue, philanthropic need reduced to $2.0-2.5M (from $2.8-4.0M)
- Year 5: $400-600K revenue, philanthropic need $1.0-1.5M, **60-70% self-sustaining**
- Year 6+: Community-owned ACCO operational, 75-85% self-sustaining, minimal philanthropic dependency

---

### RISK MITIGATION

**Community Consultation Fatigue** → Pay properly, early wins, decision-making power to communities
**Technology Adoption** → Mobile-first, offline capability, in-person support
**Funding Sustainability** → Diversified revenue from Year 1, conservative projections, capacity building
**Cultural Appropriation** → First Nations Advisory Council controls all protocols, communities own content

---

### THE ASK: $7.5M - $10.5M OVER 3 YEARS (LEVEL 2)

**What We Need:**
- Trust-based reporting (outcomes, not inputs)
- Flexibility to adapt based on community feedback
- Phased commitment with evidence gates (Year 2 contingent on Year 1 results)
- Recognition that building capacity takes 3-5 years
- Consideration of Years 4-5 support at reduced level ($2-2.5M)

**What Makes This Transformational:**
This is not ongoing programme funding. Your 3-year investment creates **permanent infrastructure** that:
- Exists **forever**, owned by communities
- Generates **sustainable revenue**
- **Reduces costs** over time through capacity building
- Continues **benefiting communities** long after philanthropic investment ends

---

### NEXT STEPS

**1. Deep Dive Meeting** (2 hours) → Walk through full proposal, clarify questions
**2. Community Consultation** (1 month) → Visit 2-3 pilot communities with Mindaroo
**3. Co-Design Workshop** (1 day) → Mindaroo + ACT + communities co-design Year 1
**4. Due Diligence** (2 weeks) → Financial, legal, reference checks
**5. Launch** (Month 5) → Begin Year 1 implementation
