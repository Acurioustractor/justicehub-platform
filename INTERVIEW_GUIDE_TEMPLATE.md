## Interview Questions

### Part 1: Introduction (5-10 minutes)

**Big Open Question:**
"Tell me about [the work you do / the young people you support / your experience with...]"

[Let them talk. Don't interrupt. Take notes on:]
- Key themes emerging
- Powerful phrases or quotes
- Specific examples they mention
- Systems or services they reference

**Follow-up prompts if needed:**
- "Tell me more about that"
- "What did that look like?"
- "How long has that been happening?"

---

### Part 2: Specific Examples (30-40 minutes)

**Case Study Questions:**

"You mentioned [specific example]. Can you walk me through that story from the beginning?"

**For each story, gently probe:**
- **Who:** Who was involved? (anonymize if needed - "a young person," "a boy")
- **What:** What exactly happened?
- **When:** How long ago? How long did it take?
- **Where:** What part of the system? Cleveland? Court? Home?
- **Why:** Why did this happen? What was missing?
- **Outcome:** What happened in the end? Where is that person now?

**Aim to get 3-5 detailed case studies.**

**Example prompts:**
- "Can you give me another example of when that happened?"
- "What's the story that sticks with you most?"
- "When you say [quote], what are you thinking of specifically?"
- "Walk me through a typical [day/call/crisis situation]"

---

### Part 3: Systems & Failures (15-20 minutes)

**Systems Questions:**

"When you're working with [young people/families], what systems do you have to navigate?"

"What do [services/government/funded programs] get wrong?"

"Why do you think [specific problem] keeps happening?"

**Look for:**
- Specific failures (not abstract - concrete examples)
- Patterns across multiple cases
- Gap between what services say they do vs. what happens
- Consequences of systems not talking to each other

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Give me an example of that"
- "How often does that happen?"
- "What should happen instead?"

---

### Part 4: Community Knowledge & Expertise (10-15 minutes)

**Expertise Questions:**

"What do you know that [services/workers/government] don't seem to know?"

"What works? When you're successful, what made the difference?"

"Is there something that no qualification or training can teach?"

**Look for:**
- Cultural knowledge
- Relationship-based approaches
- Long-term thinking vs. short-term programs
- Trust and connection
- Lived experience expertise

**Example prompts:**
- "How did you learn that?"
- "Where does that knowledge come from?"
- "Could someone learn that from a course?"

---

### Part 5: What's Needed (10-15 minutes)

**Needs Questions:**

"If you could change one thing, what would it be?"

"What would actually help?"

"What do you need? Not what you think you can get - what do you actually need?"

**Look for:**
- Resources (money, space, staff)
- Power & decision-making
- Recognition & compensation
- Infrastructure vs. services
- Voices vs. seats at tables

**Critical follow-ups:**
- "What would that look like in practice?"
- "Who needs to have that power?"
- "What would be different if you had that?"

---

### Part 6: Closing (5 minutes)

**Final Questions:**

"What haven't I asked that I should have?"

## Tips for Good Interviews

### Do:
- ✅ Let silence happen - people need time to think
- ✅ Follow their lead - they know what's important
- ✅ Ask for specific examples, not abstract concepts
- ✅ Show genuine interest and respect
- ✅ Take notes even while recording (shows you're listening)
- ✅ Repeat back what you heard to confirm understanding

### Don't:
- ❌ Interrupt when they're on a roll
- ❌ Finish their sentences
- ❌ Ask leading questions ("Isn't it true that...")
- ❌ Rush to fill silences
- ❌ Challenge or debate
- ❌ Extract and run - build a relationship

**Remember:** This isn't journalism, it's documentation of community expertise. Your job is to listen, record accurately, and help them share their knowledge on their terms.
