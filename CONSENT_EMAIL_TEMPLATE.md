## Subject: Your Story for JusticeHub - Review & Approval Needed

---

## Email Body:

Hi Aunty Corrine,

Thank you so much for sharing your story and all your knowledge with us when we visited Mount Isa. Your work supporting 25 young people over 20 years is exactly what people need to understand about community-led justice.

**We've written your story for the JusticeHub website, and we need your approval before we publish anything.**

---

### What We've Created

I've attached a draft story called **"I Need Voices Behind Me": Aunty Corrine's 20 Years of Unpaid Justice Work**

It's about 3,400 words (14 minutes to read) and includes:
- Your stories about the young people you've supported (Steven, the 25 M Valley boys, and others)
- Your insights about services and "tick-and-flick funding"
- What you said about needing voices behind you
- Your advocacy work and the support you actually need

**Every quote is exactly what you said in our conversations.** Nothing is changed or made up.

---

### What We Need from You

**Before we publish anything, we need you to:**

1. **Read the attached story** (or we can read it to you on the phone if that's easier)
2. **Tell us what to change** - anything you want different, removed, or added
3. **Give us written permission** to publish with your name and your words

**You control this story. It only goes public when you say it's ready.**

---

### What This Story Will Do

If you approve it, we'll publish it on the JusticeHub website (www.justicehub.au) where:

- **Other Aunties and community members** doing similar work can see they're not alone
- **Funders and government** can see what community-led actually looks like and why it should be funded
- **Services** can learn from your expertise about what works and what doesn't
- **Media** (like ABC, Guardian) might pick it up and share it wider

We'll also use your story as evidence in grant applications to try to get funding for:
- Compensating community experts like you
- Building infrastructure (the parks and facilities you talked about)
- Creating networks so Aunties have "voices behind them"

---

### Your Rights

**Important things to know:**

1. **You own this story** - It's your knowledge, your words, your life
2. **You can change your mind** - Even after we publish, you can ask us to take it down or change something
3. **You can say no** - If you don't want it published, that's completely okay. No pressure.
4. **Young people are protected** - We've used first names only or changed names to protect the young people you supported
5. **You won't be in trouble** - When you said "I don't care if I get myself in trouble," we made sure the story doesn't put you at risk

---

### Photos & Video (Optional)

If you have any photos you'd like us to include, we can add them. We'd need:
- A photo of you (if you're comfortable)
- Photos of your house/street (if okay with you)
- Any other images that help tell the story

We recorded our conversation - if you're okay with us using short video clips (2-3 minutes) of you talking about:
- "Tick-and-flick funding"
- "I need voices behind me"
- What young people actually need

**But this is totally optional.** The story works great with just the words.

### Thank You

Aunty, your work is incredible. Twenty years of supporting young people, unpaid, 24/7. Going to court with them. Picking them up at 3am. Making sure they have food and a safe place to stay.

**That's what "community-led" really means.**

We want to make sure your voice is heard - not just in meetings where you have to ask the first question, but everywhere. On the website. In grant applications. In the media. In policy discussions.

But we'll only do that if you say it's okay.

Thank you for trusting us with your story.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
