# PRF Strategic Alignment Map
## How JusticeHub x Contained Fellowship Aligns with PRF Framework

*This document maps your fellowship to PRF's exact strategic framework from their 2024 Strategy Pack*

---

## PRF Purpose → Fellowship Connection

**PRF Purpose:**
> "With organisations and communities, we invest in, build, and influence the conditions needed to stop disadvantage in Australia."

**How This Fellowship Embodies PRF Purpose:**

| PRF Action | Fellowship Response |
|------------|-------------------|
| **INVEST** | $220k project funds + $30k personal development directly resources community infrastructure (JusticeHub platform, Contained installation) |
| **BUILD** | Builds community capacity as co-researchers, builds digital/physical infrastructure communities own, builds economic models (revenue-sharing) |
| **INFLUENCE** | Influences policy through community-generated evidence, influences hearts & minds through dual-mode storytelling, influences resource allocation through demonstrated alternatives |
| **CONDITIONS** | Researches exact conditions needed: What infrastructure? What ownership models? What evidence formats? What partnerships? |
| **STOP DISADVANTAGE** | Youth incarceration perpetuates disadvantage; shifting to community-based support breaks the cycle |

---

## PRF Vision → Fellowship Contribution

**PRF Vision:**
> "A future where people and places have what they need to thrive."

**Fellowship's Vision:**

A future where:
- Communities OWN the infrastructure that shapes narratives about them
- Young people experience support, not incarceration
- Lived experience is valued as knowledge equal to academic research
- Economic participation flows to knowledge creators, not just knowledge extractors
- Physical and digital spaces work together to shift hearts, minds, and systems

**The Connection:**

Communities can't fully thrive while researchers extract their stories, policymakers ignore their solutions, and systems incarcerate their young people. This fellowship researches how to shift those conditions.

---

## PRF Outcomes → Fellowship Alignment

### Outcome 1: Places and Communities Are Connected, Imagining and Leading Their Own Futures

**PRF Indicators:**
- Communities are connected to each other
- Communities imagine their own futures
- Communities lead their own futures

**Fellowship Delivers:**

| PRF Outcome | How Fellowship Addresses |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Connected** | Contained brings communities together around shared evidence; JusticeHub connects organizations digitally; cohort model connects communities across regions |
| **Imagining** | Communities don't just react to detention—they imagine alternatives; Contained Room 3 showcases community solutions; JusticeHub amplifies community visions |
| **Leading** | Communities co-research (not research subjects); communities own platforms (not users); communities present to policymakers (not represented by researchers) |

**Evidence of Alignment:**
- Communities host Contained and "fill it with their solutions" (PRF language match)
- Revenue-sharing ensures economic agency (self-directed futures)
- Co-research means communities set questions, interpret findings, lead dissemination

---

### Outcome 2: Children and Young People Have Positive Life Paths Free from Entrenched Poverty and Harm

**PRF Indicators:**
- Free from poverty
- Free from harm
- Positive life paths

**Fellowship Delivers:**

| PRF Outcome | How Fellowship Addresses |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Free from Poverty** | Incarceration perpetuates poverty (disrupted education, employment); community alternatives enable continuity; research documents how to shift systems toward pathways out of poverty |
| **Free from Harm** | Detention IS harm (84% reoffend, trauma, family separation); community-based support reduces harm; fellowship researches conditions to shift from harm to healing |
| **Positive Life Paths** | Community alternatives (3% reoffend vs 84%) enable positive trajectories; when systems change, young people's paths change; fellowship researches how to make that shift happen |

**Evidence of Alignment:**
- Direct focus on youth justice system transformation
- Centering young people's voices (through JusticeHub stories)
- Measurable outcomes: Funding shifts, policy reforms, young people experiencing different system responses

---

### Outcome 3: First Nations Peoples and Communities Are Self-Determining

**PRF Indicators:**
- Self-determining
- Community-led
- Cultural authority respected

**Fellowship Delivers:**

| PRF Outcome | How Fellowship Addresses |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Self-Determining** | Ownership frameworks (communities own stories, platforms, data); economic participation (revenue-sharing); agency over research questions and dissemination |
| **Community-Led** | Not researcher-led study OF Indigenous communities, but infrastructure FOR community-led knowledge production; First Nations methodologies (story as evidence) centered |
| **Cultural Authority** | Indigenous knowledge systems (story, lived experience, community wisdom) treated as equal to academic research; communities approve all AI-extracted content |

**Evidence of Alignment:**
- First Nations young people disproportionately impacted by detention
- Indigenous methodologies (Linda Tuhiwai Smith) inform research design
- Economic models support self-determination (not charity)

---

### Outcome 4: Conditions Support Thriving

**PRF Indicators:**
- Systemic conditions shift
- Multiple factors addressed
- Sustainable change

**Fellowship Delivers:**

This fellowship researches the CONDITIONS themselves:

| Condition Type | What Fellowship Researches |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Policy Conditions** | What evidence formats influence policy? How does community-led research affect policy differently than traditional research? |
| **Economic Conditions** | Does revenue-sharing shift power? How can economic participation in knowledge production support community agency? |
| **Social Conditions** | How does narrative shift from punishment to support? What changes hearts and minds at scale? |
| **Infrastructure Conditions** | What infrastructure do communities need to lead systems change? How do physical + digital spaces work together? |
| **Knowledge Conditions** | How can multiple knowledge systems (lived experience, creative practice, data) inform policy together? |

**Evidence of Alignment:**
- Focus on conditions, not just programs
- Tests infrastructure for sustainability (communities can continue independently)
- Addresses root causes (power, economics, narrative) not symptoms

---

## PRF Approach → Fellowship Methodology

**PRF Approach:**
> "We work alongside people and organisations across sectors and communities to change policies and programs, where resources go, and hearts and minds."

**Fellowship Alignment:**

| PRF Approach Element | How Fellowship Embodies It |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Alongside** | Co-research model; communities are partners, not subjects; researcher learns FROM communities as much as with them |
| **Across Sectors** | Engages youth justice, policy, philanthropy, media, arts, technology, community sectors |
| **Change Policies & Programs** | Community-generated evidence presented to policymakers; research documents what evidence formats influence policy |
| **Where Resources Go** | Tracks whether evidence shifts funding from detention to community; tests revenue-sharing to redirect value to communities |
| **Hearts & Minds** | Contained shifts hearts through embodied experience; JusticeHub shifts minds through accumulated narrative; research documents what works |

---

## PRF's Three Levers → Fellowship Integration

### Lever 1: Policies & Programs
*"Expertise and evidence that informs programs, policies, and legislation"*

**How Fellowship Pulls This Lever:**
- Contained provides evidence base (detention vs community alternatives)
- JusticeHub stories become policy briefs, submissions, testimony
- Research documents: "What evidence format influences which policymaker?"
- Communities present directly to government (not mediated by researchers)

**Outputs:**
- Policy recommendations co-developed with communities
- Evidence packages for youth justice reform legislation
- Framework: "How Community Platforms Can Inform Policy"

---

### Lever 2: Where the Resources Go
*"Who makes decisions, how resources flow, and how the work is done"*

**How Fellowship Pulls This Lever:**
- Revenue-sharing redistributes value to storytellers (resource flow shift)
- Research demonstrates cost-effectiveness of community alternatives (influences funder decisions)
- Documents: Do funders shift investment when community-generated evidence shows impact?
- Tests: Who should make decisions about community knowledge? (communities themselves)

**Outputs:**
- Economic model for community knowledge platforms
- Cost-benefit analysis (detention vs community, community-verified)
- Recommendations for funding mechanisms that center community agency

---

### Lever 3: Hearts & Minds
*"Hearts, values and beliefs, including behaviours and the stories we tell"*

**How Fellowship Pulls This Lever:**
- Contained shifts hearts through embodied experience of alternatives
- JusticeHub shifts minds through accumulation of community narratives
- Research documents: What combination of story + evidence + experience creates lasting change?
- Tests: How does narrative shift from "punishment" to "support"?

**Outputs:**
- Communication guide: "Shifting Public Discourse from Punishment to Support"
- Media engagement strategy based on what worked
- Analysis of narrative shift during fellowship period

---

## PRF Values → Fellowship Embodiment

### Courage

**PRF Definition:** *[Taking risks, challenging status quo, backing bold ideas]*

**How Fellowship Demonstrates Courage:**
- Challenges researcher/subject power dynamics (communities as co-researchers)
- Tests economic models that redistribute resources (revenue-sharing)
- Proposes that art + technology can shift entrenched justice system
- Asks: What if we trusted communities to lead research that influences policy?

**Where You'll Need Courage:**
- Challenging conventional research ethics (AI + community ownership)
- Advocating for revenue-sharing in policy/academic spaces
- Trusting community editing of AI-extracted content
- Presenting community-generated evidence to skeptical policymakers

---

### Curiosity

**PRF Definition:** *[Learning orientation, openness to new ideas, asking questions]*

**How Fellowship Demonstrates Curiosity:**
- Asks: How do different knowledge systems work together? (lived experience + creative practice + AI analysis + evidence)
- Tests: Can communities lead rigorous research that influences policy?
- Wonders: What happens when physical + digital storytelling integrate?
- Explores: How does economic participation affect community agency?

**Research Questions Driven by Curiosity:**
1. Does visiting Contained increase JusticeHub engagement?
2. How does AI-assisted extraction compare to traditional research in honoring lived experience?
3. Which evidence formats reach which audiences, and why?
4. What creates the CONDITIONS for systems change?

---

### Connection

**PRF Definition:** *[Relationships, collaboration, networks, ecosystem thinking]*

**How Fellowship Demonstrates Connection:**
- Physical installation creates embodied connection to evidence
- Digital platform creates ongoing connection to community narratives
- Fellowship creates connections across youth justice ecosystem
- Co-research model is fundamentally about relationship (not transaction)

**Where Connection Matters:**
- Community partnerships (long-term, reciprocal, trust-based)
- PRF cohort (learning from fellow fellows, sharing methodologies)
- Cross-sector engagement (policy, philanthropy, media, community)
- Researcher ↔ Community (mutual learning, shared authority)

---

## PRF Principles → Fellowship Practice

### Agency

**PRF Definition:** *[Community power, self-determination, choice]*

**How Fellowship Enables Agency:**
- Communities choose which stories to share
- Communities edit AI-extracted content before publication
- Communities decide when to participate in revenue-sharing
- Communities control their data and narratives
- Research serves community goals, not just academic outputs

**Evidence of Agency:**
- Ownership frameworks (communities OWN stories, not just tell them)
- Consent processes (ongoing, not one-time)
- Economic participation (communities benefit when stories create value)
- Co-research (communities shape questions, interpret findings)

---

### Relationships

**PRF Definition:** *[Long-term partnerships, trust, reciprocity]*

**How Fellowship Prioritizes Relationships:**
- Long-term partnerships with host communities (not extractive research)
- Reciprocal: JusticeHub provides infrastructure, communities provide knowledge, BOTH benefit
- Trust-building: Communities approve all content before publication
- Relational ethics: If research doesn't serve community, we don't do it

**Not Transactional:**
- Not: "We'll study you and publish about you"
- Instead: "We'll co-research together and you'll own the infrastructure"

---

### Reciprocity

**PRF Definition:** *[Mutual benefit, giving and receiving, fair exchange]*

**How Fellowship Embodies Reciprocity:**
- **Economic:** Revenue-sharing when stories create value
- **Knowledge:** Communities gain research capacity; researcher gains community wisdom
- **Impact:** Research serves community goals (policy change) not just academic outputs
- **Infrastructure:** Communities gain platform they continue to own after fellowship ends

**Evidence of Reciprocity:**
- Communities compensated for participation
- Economic model redistributes value
- Research outputs serve community advocacy
- Platform ownership remains with communities

---

## PRF Focus Areas → Fellowship Research Questions

### People and Places

**PRF Focus:**
> "Individuals, their families, and the places they live"

**Fellowship Research:**
- How do place-based installations (Contained in specific communities) create different impact than centralized exhibitions?
- How do young people and their families experience dual-mode storytelling (physical + digital)?
- What role does place play in systems change? (Does community hosting create different ownership?)

---

### Life-Course Transitions

**PRF Focus:**
> "Early years to adulthood"

**Fellowship Research:**
- How does youth justice system contact affect life trajectories?
- What transitions are disrupted by detention vs supported by community alternatives?
- How do early interventions (community support vs incarceration) affect adult outcomes?

---

### Basic Human Needs and Where Resources Go

**PRF Focus:**
> "Distribution and transfers of resources, social mobility, housing, welfare systems. Access to resources and opportunities."

**Fellowship Research:**
- How do we shift resources from incarceration ($2,355/day) to community support ($75/day)?
- What evidence convinces funders to reallocate? (testing through presenting findings to funding bodies)
- How does economic participation in storytelling affect access to resources?

**Direct Connection:**
- Contained makes resource allocation visible (cost comparisons in installation)
- Revenue-sharing tests new resource distribution models
- Research documents what shifts funding decisions

---

### Ecosystem Responses

**PRF Focus:**
> "Access to resources and opportunities. Connections, capability, and leadership. Societal responses: dignity, inclusion, media, democratised information, and social, digital, and civic engagement. Environmental infrastructure: transport, accessibility, and green space."

**Fellowship Research:**

| PRF Focus | Fellowship Question |
|-----------|-------------------|

**Fellowship Research:**

| PRF Focus | Fellowship Question |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Relationships** | How does co-research change researcher/community relationships? |
| **Healing** | How do community alternatives support healing vs re-traumatization of detention? |
| **Culture** | How does centering Indigenous methodologies honor cultural knowledge systems? |
| **Belonging** | How do community-owned platforms create belonging? |
| **Social Attitudes** | How does Contained shift attitudes toward young people in justice system? |
| **Stories** | Which storytelling formats shift beliefs? How do physical + digital stories combine? |
| **Trust** | Does community ownership increase trust in research/evidence? |

---

### Social Purpose Ecosystem

**PRF Focus:**
> "What resources are available, for who, and where"

**Fellowship Research:**
- Maps the youth justice ecosystem (decision-makers, funders, service providers, media)
- Documents how resources flow (or don't flow) to communities
- Tests whether community-owned platforms shift power dynamics in ecosystem
- Analyzes: Who benefits from current resource allocation? Who could benefit from shifts?

---

## PRF Grant-Making Decision Framework → Fellowship Fit

PRF asks these questions of every grant. Here's how the fellowship answers each:

### Will this grant contribute to PRF's long-term outcomes?

**YES**

✅ Children and young people have positive life paths (shifting from incarceration to community support)
✅ Places and communities imagine and lead their own futures (ownership of infrastructure)
✅ First Nations peoples are self-determining (Indigenous methodologies, economic models)
✅ Conditions support thriving (researching the conditions themselves)

---

### Does it shift conditions for: People | Places

**YES**

**People:**
- First Nations young people (overrepresented in detention)
- Young people in or at risk of detention
- Families affected by justice system
- Community workers supporting young people

**Places:**
- Bottom 10% SEIFA areas with concentrated disadvantage
- Communities with high youth detention rates
- Regional and urban areas hosting Contained
- Places experiencing pockets of disadvantage

---

### Does it address: Intersecting Root Causes | Capability & Connections | Systems Change

**YES**

**Intersecting Root Causes:**
- Poverty (detention disrupts education/employment)
- Harm (detention as trauma, vs community support as healing)
- Power (who makes decisions about communities)
- Economics (resource allocation, value extraction vs redistribution)

**Capability & Connections:**
- Builds community research capability
- Connects communities across regions (through JusticeHub platform)
- Develops community leadership (presenting to policymakers)
- Strengthens cross-sector connections (policy, philanthropy, media)

**Systems Change:**
- Tests how to shift hearts & minds at scale
- Documents what evidence influences policy
- Analyzes how resources flow (or could flow) differently
- Creates infrastructure for sustained community-led change

---

### Will it affect: Policies & Programs | Where the Resources Go | Hearts & Minds

**YES** - All Three Levers

**Policies & Programs:**
- Community-generated evidence presented to youth justice departments
- Research documents what evidence formats influence policy
- Policy recommendations co-developed with communities

**Where the Resources Go:**
- Revenue-sharing tests new economic models
- Research tracks whether evidence shifts funding from detention to community
- Documents what convinces funders to reallocate

**Hearts & Minds:**
- Contained shifts public perception through embodied experience
- JusticeHub accumulates community narratives that change discourse
- Research analyzes what combination of story + evidence + experience creates lasting belief change

---

### Can PRF use its resources to: Invest | Build | Influence

**YES** - All Three

**Invest:**
- $250k fellowship investment directly resources community infrastructure
- Enables communities to participate economically (not just as research subjects)
- Demonstrates PRF's commitment to community ownership models

**Build:**
- Builds community capacity as co-researchers
- Builds digital and physical infrastructure communities own
- Builds new economic models (revenue-sharing)
- Builds relationships across youth justice ecosystem

**Influence:**
- Influences policy through PRF's government networks + community evidence
- Influences hearts and minds through dual-mode storytelling
- Influences resource allocation through demonstrated alternatives
- Influences sector practice through open-source methodology

---

### Are we able to draw on: The Big Picture | Lived Experience | Evidence | Theory of Change

**YES** - All Four

**The Big Picture:**
- Youth justice is microcosm of how systems treat disadvantage (punishment vs support)
- Fellowship connects to broader questions: Who controls knowledge? How do systems change? What infrastructure enables community self-determination?

**Lived Experience:**
- Centers young people and families affected by justice system
- Recognizes lived experience as expertise, not anecdote
- Community co-researchers bring deep knowledge

**Evidence:**
- Contained presents clear comparative evidence (detention vs community alternatives)
- Research generates new evidence: Does physical + digital integration work? Do ownership models shift power?
- Multiple forms of evidence: quantitative (costs, outcomes), qualitative (stories), experiential (installation)

**Theory of Change:**

```
IF communities own infrastructure for knowledge production (physical + digital)
AND economic participation enables agency (revenue-sharing)
AND multiple knowledge systems inform policy (lived experience + creative practice + evidence)
THEN conditions shift (hearts/minds, resources, policies)
THEN communities lead systems change (not researchers, not policymakers)
THEN young people experience different life paths (community support vs incarceration)
THEN cycles of disadvantage break
```

## Key Alignment Strengths

### 1. Direct Match to PRF Strategic Outcomes

This fellowship doesn't just "relate to" PRF outcomes—it directly advances all three:
- Positive life paths for young people (youth justice transformation)
- Communities leading their own futures (ownership of infrastructure)
- First Nations self-determination (Indigenous methodologies, economic models)

### 2. Exemplifies PRF's Approach

The fellowship IS the approach PRF describes:
- Works alongside communities (not for them)
- Addresses all three levers (policies, resources, hearts/minds)
- Focuses on conditions, not just programs
- Integrates multiple knowledge systems

### 3. Embodies PRF Values and Principles

**Values:** Courage (challenges power dynamics) + Curiosity (asks how knowledge systems integrate) + Connection (relationship-based)

**Principles:** Agency (community ownership) + Relationships (long-term partnerships) + Reciprocity (economic and knowledge exchange)

### 4. Fills PRF's "Horizon Questions"

PRF asks: *"What possibilities on the next horizon are we not yet thinking about?"*

**This fellowship's answer:**

> "We haven't yet imagined infrastructure for knowledge production that communities OWN—where lived experience isn't extracted but economically valued, where physical and digital storytelling work together to shift systems, where the people most impacted also control the platforms that influence policy."

### 5. Addresses PRF's Knowledge Gaps

PRF asks: *"How can we draw from multiple knowledge systems?"*

**This fellowship tests exactly that:**
- Indigenous knowledge (story as evidence)
- Lived experience (young people and families)
- Creative practice (embodied installation as research methodology)
- Technology (AI-assisted pattern recognition)
- Academic research (systems analysis)

**Not choosing between them—integrating them.**

---

## Potential Interview Questions & Alignment-Based Answers

### Q: "How will this contribute to systems change?"

**Answer Framework (Using PRF Language):**

"Systems change requires shifting conditions—not just programs. This fellowship researches the exact conditions PRF identifies: where resources go, policies and programs, and hearts and minds.

By testing how physical installations and digital platforms work together, we're asking: What infrastructure do communities need to lead policy change? Does ownership shift power dynamics? Which evidence formats influence which audiences?

The goal isn't better programs—it's creating conditions where communities can shift systems themselves."

---

### Q: "Why is community ownership central to this?"

**Answer Framework (Using PRF Principles):**

"PRF's principles are agency, relationships, and reciprocity. Community ownership embodies all three:

- **Agency:** Communities choose what to share, edit AI-extracted content, control their data
- **Relationships:** Long-term partnerships where communities own infrastructure that continues after fellowship
- **Reciprocity:** Economic participation when stories create value—not extraction, but exchange

This aligns with PRF's focus on self-determination: communities can't fully lead their futures without owning the infrastructure that shapes narratives about them."

---

### Q: "How is this different from other storytelling projects?"

**Answer Framework (Using PRF's Innovation Criteria):**

"Three differences align with PRF's focus on pioneering work:

**1. Integration:** No one has tested whether physical + digital storytelling creates deeper systems change than either alone—that's the research question.

**2. Economic Model:** Revenue-sharing when stories create value is pioneering in Australia—tests whether economic participation shifts community agency.

**3. Knowledge Systems:** We're not choosing between lived experience, creative practice, and data—we're researching how they work together to inform policy.

It's not just telling stories—it's researching the conditions that enable communities to shift systems through story."

---

### Q: "What if communities don't want to participate?"

**Answer Framework (Using PRF's Community-Led Values):**

"Then we don't do it—because this research only works if it serves community goals.

That's why the methodology starts with: 'How does this serve community interests?' If communities don't see value, the research itself fails.

But early conversations suggest communities WANT this:
- They want infrastructure they own (not just platforms they use)
- They want economic participation (not just awareness)
- They want to lead policy influence (not be represented by researchers)

PRF's principle of agency means communities decide—not the researcher deciding for them."

---

### Q: "How will you measure success?"

**Answer Framework (Using PRF's Success Criteria):**

"PRF identifies six indicators of successful fellowships. This research addresses all:

1. **New collaborations:** Communities, policymakers, funders working together on community-led change
2. **Enhanced capability:** Communities gain research skills, policy influence skills, platform ownership
3. **Seats at decision-making tables:** Communities presenting to government, consulted as standard practice
4. **Media attention:** Public discourse shifts from punishment to support
5. **New ways of working:** Sector adopts community ownership models
6. **Network coalescence:** Youth justice ecosystem aligns around community-led approaches

Plus community-defined success: Young people experience different life paths."
