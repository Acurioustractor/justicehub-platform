# QUESTION 9: Why You're a Great Candidate (500 words)

## Ben's Personalized Response

I bring two decades of experience working at the intersection of community knowledge and institutional systems, combined with the technical and creative skills to translate that understanding into infrastructure communities can own.

**Demonstrated Leadership Across Systems**

I've navigated every level of the systems this fellowship investigates: as a youth support worker and refuge coordinator (2004-2006), facilitating offending programs for 300+ participants at Queensland Corrective Services (2010-2014), documenting homelessness stories as Brand and Communications Manager at Orange Sky (2016-2020), and integrating Indigenous systems thinking with digital platforms at AIME (2020-2023). I don't study these systems academically—I've worked within them, understanding both their potential and their failures.

From this foundation, I co-founded A Curious Tractor and built JusticeHub as a platform for grassroots organizations, and Contained as an immersive installation challenging youth detention approaches. These aren't proposals—they're working prototypes developed through deep community partnerships, launching October 2025.

**Technical and Creative Integration**

My technical expertise spans digital platform development, AI ethics, and participatory design. I understand technology not as neutral tool but as infrastructure that either serves community agency or extracts community value. At AIME, I helped develop IMAGI-NATION digital platform connecting marginalized youth with opportunities, learning how to build systems communities control.

My creative practice—honed through photography at Orange Sky and installation design for Contained—taught me that embodied experience shifts understanding differently than data. I know how physical spaces create connection that reports cannot.

This combination—technical depth and creative sensibility, digital infrastructure and physical installation—positions me uniquely to research their integration for systems change.

**Systems Thinking Grounded in Community Wisdom**

Working with Aboriginal communities at AIME fundamentally shifted my approach. I learned to listen before prescribing, recognizing that 60,000 years of Indigenous systems thinking offers frameworks modern policy ignores. This fellowship centers those methodologies—story as evidence, community as authority, sovereignty over knowledge—rather than treating them as consultation box-ticking.

I understand youth justice not as isolated programs but as ecosystem: policies, funding flows, public narratives, community responses. I've navigated between community, corrections, policy, nonprofit, creative, and technology sectors—speaking across silos while maintaining accountability to communities.

**Values Alignment with PRF**

**Courage:** I challenge power dynamics by proposing communities as co-researchers who own platforms and benefit economically through revenue-sharing. I've spent my career making institutions uncomfortable by centering community authority.

**Curiosity:** I genuinely don't know how physical and digital integration works for systems change—that's why this is research. I'm driven to understand how different knowledge systems can inform policy together, not compete.

**Connection:** Every project I've built—from Positive Futures Program in corrections to IMAGI-NATION digital platform to JusticeHub—emerged from relationships with communities, not solo ideation. My work is fundamentally collaborative.

**Why Now**

After twenty years working in systems, I've reached a clarity: we don't need better programs delivered to communities; we need better infrastructure owned by communities. JusticeHub and Contained prove I can build that infrastructure. This fellowship enables rigorous research into whether it actually shifts the conditions—hearts, minds, policies, resources—that determine young people's life paths.

I'm ready because communities are ready. Contained launches October 2025. Youth justice reform is active policy conversation. The evidence about community-based alternatives is irrefutable. What's missing is research documenting the conditions that enable communities to lead systems change themselves.

This fellowship researches exactly that—with me as facilitator, communities as architects.

## Alternative Endings (If You Want Different Emphasis)

### Option B: More Focus on Fellowship Cohort Value

**Replace final paragraphs with:**

**What I Bring to Fellowship Cohort**

I offer practical knowledge about integrating technology with community accountability, creative methodologies for immersive storytelling, and hard-won lessons about what makes institutions uncomfortable enough to change. I'm eager to share openly about failures—like MouthZoff Music Street Press, where I learned vulnerability when initial success didn't sustain—as much as successes.

**What I Need from Cohort**

Policy expertise navigating government engagement, deeper understanding of First Nations methodologies beyond my AIME experience, cross-sector insights from fellows working on different systems, and honest feedback when I miss community accountability.

This fellowship enables me to research what I've spent twenty years building toward: demonstrating that communities don't need better advocates—they need ownership of the platforms that shift systems. I'm ready to explore that rigorously, humbly, and collaboratively.

### Option C: More Emphasis on Lived Experience Journey

**Insert after first paragraph:**

**Personal Journey Through Systems**

My path wasn't linear. I started in Muswellbrook, NSW, where family instilled values of empathy and curiosity about human experience. Prison visits in Bolivia showed me resilience in unexpected places—people society discarded holding profound wisdom. That pattern repeated throughout my career: in Queensland prisons, on Australian streets with people experiencing homelessness, in Aboriginal communities with 60,000 years of knowledge—those most impacted by systems consistently held the clearest vision of what needed changing.
