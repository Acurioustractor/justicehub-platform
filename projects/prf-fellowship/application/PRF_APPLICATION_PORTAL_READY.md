## QUESTION 3: Overview of Idea and Questions (500 words max)

Young people in Australia are incarcerated at enormous cost with devastating outcomes: Brisbane Youth Detention costs $2,355 per day with 84% reoffending. Meanwhile, some community-based alternatives report reoffend rates as low as 3% at $75 per day. Evidence in multiple jurisdictions is strong—yet systems don't change. Why? Because communities lack infrastructure to translate lived experience into policy influence.

This fellowship researches whether **dual-mode engagement**—combining physical immersive installations (Contained) with digital storytelling platforms (JusticeHub)—creates conditions for communities to lead systems change in youth justice. **The fellowship does not fund program delivery; it tests and documents whether this integration model creates conditions for systems change.**

**Contained** is an immersive installation contrasting detention outcomes with community alternatives, designed to be hosted by communities who "fill it with their solutions." **JusticeHub** is a digital platform enabling grassroots organizations to publish community stories using AI-assisted extraction, with ownership frameworks and revenue-sharing.

Through A Curious Tractor, I've spent recent years visiting and telling stories with communities across Mount Isa, Alice Springs, North Stradbroke Island, Brisbane, and Palm Island—working alongside Indigenous community-owned and run organizations supporting ideation and innovation in community-led youth justice and support programs. This groundwork revealed a consistent pattern: communities hold profound knowledge about what works, but lack owned infrastructure to translate that knowledge into policy influence and resource allocation. They're consulted, then ignored. Their stories are extracted, then researchers benefit. Their solutions work, then funding disappears.

This fellowship builds on those relationships to test whether community-owned infrastructure changes that dynamic.

**The research questions:**

1. How does integrating physical embodiment (Contained) with ongoing digital engagement (JusticeHub) create conditions for systems change differently than either alone?

2. Does community ownership of storytelling infrastructure—including economic participation through revenue-sharing—shift power dynamics in policy influence?

3. How can multiple knowledge systems (lived experience, Indigenous methodologies, creative practice, AI-assisted analysis, evidence) work together to inform transformational policy change?

Working **with** communities as co-researchers—not research subjects—this fellowship tests and documents what creates the conditions for communities to shift hearts and minds, resource allocation, and policies themselves. Not what programs work, but what infrastructure enables communities to lead change.

For example, a community hosting Contained will use JusticeHub to publish local stories emerging from the installation experience. We'll track how those stories travel into media coverage, funding decisions, and policy conversations. When stories create value (republished, cited, influencing funding), communities receive economic participation through revenue-sharing. The research documents whether this ownership model affects community agency, policy influence, and long-term sustainability differently than conventional research extraction.

The fellowship partners with communities already pioneering alternatives—organizations I've built relationships with through A Curious Tractor's storytelling work across Queensland, Northern Territory, and beyond. They're ready to co-research the exact conditions needed to shift systems from incarceration toward community support.

## QUESTION 4: Why Is This Important to You? (250 words max)

This fellowship emerges from a journey that began in Bolivian prisons, where I witnessed resilience in unlikely places. As a prison visitor, then facilitating offending programs for 300+ participants at Queensland Corrective Services, I saw that people trapped in systems often held the clearest vision of what needed to change. Yet their knowledge rarely shaped the systems themselves.

At Orange Sky, photographing people experiencing homelessness across Australia, I learned every person has a story worth telling. But I also learned something harder: telling stories isn't enough if power remains unchanged. At AIME, working with Indigenous communities, I encountered 60,000 years of systems thinking that modern policy continues to ignore.

Through A Curious Tractor, visiting Mount Isa, Alice Springs, North Stradbroke Island, Brisbane, and Palm Island, I've sat with Indigenous elders, youth workers, and young people themselves—listening to their solutions for community-led youth justice. The pattern is consistent: communities don't need us to solve their problems. They need infrastructure to implement their own solutions. They need to own the platforms that tell their stories and benefit when those stories create value.

This fellowship matters because I've spent two decades working **in** systems and seen the cycle: we fund programs that work, then dismantle them when funding ends. We commission research that extracts community knowledge, then shelve reports. We celebrate individual success stories while systems remain unchanged.

The question that drives this work: What if communities owned the infrastructure itself—digital, physical, economic? What if grassroots workers supporting young people could translate their wisdom into policy influence?

If this fellowship succeeds, we demonstrate that the path to systems change isn't better research **about** communities, but better infrastructure **for** communities to lead change themselves.

## QUESTION 5: How It Breaks New Ground (250 words max)

This fellowship pioneers three areas unexplored in Australian research:

**1. Physical + Digital Integration for Systems Change**

No existing research tests whether combining immersive art installations with ongoing digital storytelling platforms creates deeper systems change than either alone. Current approaches separate: program evaluations produce evidence but don't shift hearts; awareness campaigns change perception but don't redistribute resources; art installations move emotions but lack sustained engagement; digital platforms create reach but miss embodied connection. This fellowship researches their integration—the hypothesis that multi-modal engagement (physical embodiment + digital infrastructure) creates conditions for transformational change.

**2. Community Ownership as Research Methodology**

Traditional research studies communities. This fellowship provides infrastructure communities **own**—economically (revenue-sharing when stories create value) and technically (platforms they control). It tests whether redistributing power in knowledge production affects policy outcomes differently than conventional research. Economic participation in storytelling is pioneering in Australia, challenging who benefits when community knowledge creates value.

**3. Multiple Knowledge Systems Integration**

Indigenous methodologies recognize story as evidence. Creative practice recognizes embodied experience as knowledge. Technology recognizes pattern detection as insight. Academic research recognizes systematic analysis. Rather than privileging one, this fellowship researches how they work **together** to inform policy. It asks: Can AI serve community agency rather than extract from it? Can lived experience, creative practice, and data integrate for systems influence?

This breaks conventional thinking that positions researcher as expert studying communities. Instead, communities become co-researchers investigating the exact conditions needed to shift systems—with infrastructure they own, knowledge they control, and economic participation they deserve.

## QUESTION 6: Approach and Methodology (500 words max)

This fellowship uses **participatory action research** methodology, centering communities as co-researchers investigating systems change together. The approach integrates community partnership, creative practice, digital ethnography, and systems analysis across four phases. **If needed, we will prioritize depth over breadth—focusing on 3-5 communities for deeper analysis rather than maximum numbers at the expense of rigorous learning.**

**Phase 1: Establish Baseline (Months 1-3)**

Launch Contained installation in three communities targeting areas with high youth detention rates. Document visitor responses through surveys (n=100+ per site) and semi-structured interviews (n=20-30 per site); track policy-maker attendance, media coverage, and community reactions using media monitoring tools. Simultaneously, onboard ten grassroots organizations to JusticeHub platform, training communities in AI-assisted story extraction and establishing ownership/revenue-sharing frameworks.

**Critical integration measurement:** Track whether Contained visitors engage with JusticeHub stories (via QR codes, unique URLs); monitor whether digital story readers seek physical installation experience. Map the youth justice policy ecosystem: decision-makers, funders, influencers, and how evidence currently moves through this system.

**Phase 2: Deep Community Engagement (Months 4-9)**

Partner with five communities hosting Contained as co-researchers. Conduct story-gathering workshops with young people, families, and community workers affected by youth justice system. Use JusticeHub's AI (simple, established transcription and summarization tools, not experimental models) to extract themes, quotes, and case studies from interview transcripts, with the **critical ethical step** that communities review, edit, and approve all AI-extracted content before publication.

**Analytical approach:** We will use mixed-method analysis including qualitative coding of interview transcripts and stories using thematic analysis, basic descriptive statistics of engagement metrics (visitor numbers, story views, funding applications), and simple network mapping of how stories travel between community, media, and policy actors.

Document: How does AI-assisted extraction compare to traditional research in honoring lived experience? How does community editing affect AI outputs? What does "consent" mean in AI-assisted storytelling? Map how stories move through the ecosystem: community → media → policy. Implement revenue-sharing when stories are republished or cited, documenting whether economic participation affects community engagement, trust, and agency.

**Phase 3: Test Systems Change Hypotheses (Months 10-12)**

Communities present findings to state/federal policymakers, youth justice departments, and funding bodies. Document: How do policymakers respond to community-generated evidence versus traditional research? What evidence formats influence which decisions?

Measure hearts and minds shift through: media content analysis (coding for framing shifts from "punishment" to "support"), public discourse tracking via social media sentiment analysis, interviews with journalists and advocates. Track narrative change indicators.

Monitor resource flow: Does evidence contribute to funding shifts from detention to community programs? Do organizations using JusticeHub gain new funding opportunities? What evidence convinces funders to reallocate? (Track via funder interviews and grant outcome data.)

**Phase 4: Synthesis and Dissemination (Months 13-18)**

Analyze findings across research questions using triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data. Identify: What conditions enabled systems change? What prevented it? How did physical and digital integration work? What role did community ownership play?

Create outputs for multiple audiences:
- **Communities:** Open-source playbook enabling replication
- **Funders:** Investment guide for community knowledge infrastructure
- **Policymakers:** Evidence brief on community-led research effectiveness
- **Sector:** Methodology paper on digital platforms as sites of self-determination

**Ethical Framework:**
All research follows principles of community consent (ongoing, not one-time), economic reciprocity, knowledge sovereignty (communities own data), and dual accountability (serves community goals AND contributes to knowledge).

## QUESTION 7: PRF Purpose Contribution (250 words max)

PRF's purpose is working with organizations and communities to "invest in, build, and influence the conditions needed to stop disadvantage in Australia." This fellowship embodies each element:

**INVEST:** $250,000 directly resources community infrastructure—physical installations communities host and digital platforms communities own. Investment flows to communities as knowledge producers, not just research subjects, with revenue-sharing ensuring economic participation when stories create value.

**BUILD:** Builds community capacity as co-researchers, developing skills in policy influence, digital storytelling, and systems analysis. Builds infrastructure communities control and can sustain after fellowship ends. Builds new economic models demonstrating how communities can benefit from their knowledge. Builds relationships across the youth justice ecosystem—policy, philanthropy, media, grassroots.

**INFLUENCE:** Influences policy through community-generated evidence presented directly to government. Influences hearts and minds through dual-mode storytelling (embodied experience + digital narrative). Influences resource allocation by documenting that community-based programs ($75/day, 3% reoffend) vastly outperform detention ($2,355/day, 84% reoffend).

**CONDITIONS:** Researches the exact conditions needed: What infrastructure enables community policy influence? Does ownership shift power dynamics? Which evidence formats move which audiences? How do physical and digital spaces work together? This fellowship doesn't assume the conditions—it rigorously investigates them.

**STOP DISADVANTAGE:** Youth incarceration perpetuates disadvantage across generations. Shifting systems from punishment to community support breaks cycles by enabling positive life paths, community self-determination, and places leading their own futures.

It does this in ways that align with PRF's values: **courage** (challenging existing power structures through community ownership), **curiosity** (testing new combinations of tools and knowledge systems), and **connection** (centering long-term relationships with communities over transactional research).

The fellowship IS PRF's purpose in action—creating conditions where communities lead the systems change needed to stop disadvantage.

## QUESTION 8: Long-Term Impact (250 words max)

**Immediate Impact (During Fellowship):**
Five to ten communities host Contained, reaching 1,000+ people with immersive evidence. Fifty organizations use JusticeHub, publishing 200+ community stories with ownership and consent. Policy-makers engage with community-generated evidence in 15+ meetings. Media coverage begins shifting public discourse from punishment toward community support.

**Contributing to Policy Impact (2-5 Years):**
Fellowship findings contribute to informing state and territory youth justice reforms. Research provides evidence that helps advocates make the case for funding to redirect from detention centers toward community-based programs. Communities gain more regular seats at policy tables—moving from exceptional to standard consultation. Government agencies begin adopting community storytelling platforms for evidence gathering, acknowledging lived experience as authoritative knowledge.

**Contributing to Sector Transformation (2-5 Years):**
Organizations working on homelessness, education, health consider adopting dual-mode methodology—recognizing that physical and digital integration may create deeper systems change. Philanthropic funders increase investment in community knowledge infrastructure. Revenue-sharing for community stories gains traction as ethical practice, challenging extractive research models.

**Community Self-Determination (Ongoing):**
Communities independently operate Contained and JusticeHub without researcher mediation. Young people experience tangible system changes: diverted from detention, connected to community support, life paths genuinely altered. First Nations communities use infrastructure to advance self-determination on their terms, with economic participation supporting sovereignty.

**Ultimate Aspiration:**
The fellowship is designed so its findings can be picked up by advocates, communities and policymakers to contribute to shifts over time. Ten years from now, when policymakers need evidence about disadvantage, community platforms are among their trusted sources—not just university researchers. Communities own infrastructure that shapes narratives about them. Young people who would have been incarcerated are instead supported by communities to thrive.

## QUESTION 9: Why You're a Great Candidate (500 words max)

I bring two decades of experience working at the intersection of community knowledge and institutional systems, combined with the technical and creative skills to translate that understanding into infrastructure communities can own.

**Demonstrated Leadership Across Systems**

I've navigated every level of the systems this fellowship investigates: as a youth support worker and refuge coordinator (2004-2006), facilitating offending programs for 300+ participants at Queensland Corrective Services (2010-2014), documenting homelessness stories as Brand and Communications Manager at Orange Sky (2016-2020), and integrating Indigenous systems thinking with digital platforms at AIME (2020-2023). I don't study these systems academically—I've worked within them, understanding both their potential and their failures.

Through A Curious Tractor, I've built deep relationships with Indigenous community-owned organizations across Mount Isa, Alice Springs, North Stradbroke Island, Brisbane, and Palm Island—visiting, listening, and telling stories alongside communities pioneering youth justice alternatives. This isn't research tourism; it's sustained engagement with communities who will be co-researchers in this fellowship, testing whether the infrastructure we build together creates conditions for systems change.

From this foundation, I've built JusticeHub as a platform for grassroots organizations, and Contained as an immersive installation challenging youth detention approaches. These are emerging prototypes developed through deep community partnerships, launching October 2025. **The fellowship asks: do they actually change conditions for systems change, and if so, how?**

**Technical and Creative Integration**

My technical expertise spans digital platform development, AI ethics, and participatory design. I understand technology not as neutral tool but as infrastructure that either serves community agency or extracts community value. At AIME, I helped develop IMAGI-NATION digital platform connecting marginalized youth with opportunities, learning how to build systems communities control.

My creative practice—honed through photography at Orange Sky and installation design for Contained—taught me that embodied experience shifts understanding differently than data. I know how physical spaces create connection that reports cannot.

This combination—technical depth and creative sensibility, digital infrastructure and physical installation—positions me uniquely to research their integration for systems change.

**Systems Thinking Grounded in Community Wisdom**

Working with Aboriginal communities at AIME fundamentally shifted my approach. I learned to listen before prescribing, recognizing that 60,000 years of Indigenous systems thinking offers frameworks modern policy ignores. This fellowship centers those methodologies—story as evidence, community as authority, sovereignty over knowledge—rather than treating them as consultation box-ticking.

I understand youth justice not as isolated programs but as ecosystem: policies, funding flows, public narratives, community responses. I've navigated between community, corrections, policy, nonprofit, creative, and technology sectors—speaking across silos while maintaining accountability to communities.

**Values Alignment with PRF**

**Courage:** I challenge power dynamics by proposing communities as co-researchers who own platforms and benefit economically through revenue-sharing.

**Curiosity:** I genuinely don't know how physical and digital integration works for systems change—that's why this is research.

**Connection:** Every project I've built emerged from relationships with communities, not solo ideation.

**Why Now**

I have previously led multi-stakeholder projects of similar scale and complexity at AIME and Orange Sky, coordinating across government, community and creative teams to deliver on time and within scope. I'm ready because communities are ready. Youth justice reform is active policy conversation. The evidence about community-based alternatives is strong. What's missing is research documenting the conditions that enable communities to lead systems change themselves.

This fellowship researches exactly that—with me as facilitator, communities as architects.
