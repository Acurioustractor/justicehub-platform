# "You're Our Paycheck": What One Aunty Knows About Youth Justice That Services Don't
## A Portrait of Community Expertise in Mount Isa

*Draft blog post - For Aunty Corrine's approval before publication*

---

Aunty Corrine has taken five police officers to court. And won. Every single time.

Those officers will never get promoted. They'll remain constables for the rest of their careers.

"They were really crying," she says, matter-of-fact. "I told them, 'You don't deserve a promotion.'"

This is what accountability looks like when community members refuse to be silent.

---

## The Voice

Aunty Corrine speaks at every meeting. She shows up to consultations she wasn't invited to. She walks in the door and says, "I don't know if I'm invited but I'm gonna sit down here."

"Every meeting I go to, I always say that," she explains, referring to her habit of calling out system failures. "And a lot of people say, 'Oh, you need to stop running your mouth or you're gonna get in trouble.' I say, 'I don't care because it's our children that miss out.'"

She pauses. "I got the voice. But I got no backup."

That lack of backup is precisely the problem. Because Aunty Corrine—and Aunties like her across Australia—are doing the most sophisticated systems navigation work you'll find anywhere. Unpaid. Unacknowledged. And absolutely essential.

---

## The Knowledge

On any given day, Aunty Corrine might:

- Ring housing to save a house while someone's in custody (she knows the policy: board it up for $10-$20/week)
- Call Townsville Hospital to coordinate with a social worker
- Navigate a child protection case
- Provide crisis accommodation in her own home
- Coordinate across police, courts, mental health, and education

"I do all my own wheeling and dealing," she says.

This isn't just crisis response. This is **expert cross-system navigation** that requires deep knowledge of:

- Housing policies
- Bail conditions and no-contact orders
- Mental health referral pathways
- Child protection timelines
- Which police departments communicate with each other (spoiler: they don't)
- Which services actually help versus which just "tick and flick" for funding

When I ask how she learned all this, she laughs. "Someone told me about Next Step funding [for 18-21 year olds exiting child protection]. So I let my committee know, the Waba Natra, I let the DB know, I let Connect Up know. Why am I going around telling all these people about all these monies?"

Why indeed.

Services get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for "case coordination." Aunty Corrine does it from her living room. For free.

---

## The Economics

Aunty Corrine sees the economics clearly.

"I even tell them, you know, at the end of the day, **we give our kids a paycheck**," she says, referring to service providers. "I said, you take all our naughty kids out of the system, mate, they don't have a paycheck. They don't even have a job."

It's a brutal analysis. And it's correct.

Services get funded based on how many young people they "serve." More young people in the system = more funding. Success—young people thriving and exiting—means loss of revenue.

"We've got a lot of fundings here, sorry to say. They're not giving the service," Aunty Corrine says. "**Tick and flick funding keep rolling in. So I can be a number. I can just go there once, so that's my number for the funding.** So my number's added, they send it all away."

Meanwhile, Aunty Corrine took in 25 young people. "They were called the MBBs [her area]. They used to run amok here. We used to go and get them off the street."

She worked with them for years. No funding. Just family.

---

## The Labor

The work is relentless.

When she was at Indalungi (community organization), she took bags of clothes into the watch house. "Them little girls didn't have anything. And when they were going through their periods, I had to make sure that they had all them things. The government didn't even provide that. I was taking big bags of clothes into the watch house for our kids. I was getting them from Lifeline, Salvation Army. St. Vinnie's used to give me $100—I'd pay $100 for a pallet of clothes."

She advocates at hospitals. One time, a young person was suicidal, walking around naked. The family begged mental health to help. They gave him a "safe bed" but he walked out.

"I rang mental health, and I said, 'Can you put me through to the nurse that's looking after this boy?' And they said no. And I said, 'Well, I need to know where he is.' And they said, 'No, he's in his room.' I said, 'Can you just put me through to somebody else, please? Because he's not there. He's actually walked out of your premises.'"

They found him. Put him back in hospital. Five minutes later, sent him back to Cleveland Youth Detention Centre.

"So he got no help."

---

## Cleveland: The Black Box

Cleveland comes up again and again in our conversation. It's where young people disappear. Where families are shut out.

Aunty Corrine's grandson Benjamin has been in and out of Cleveland since he was 12 and a half. He's 20 now.

One time, she drove to Townsville for a Sunday visitation. They'd specially arranged it for her.

"I went out there at 12 o'clock. That was the time for the visitation. Went there, waited in this room—very lonely, very depressing, very stressful. They went to look for Benjamin. They said, 'Oh no, he don't want to visit because he's sick.'"

She went home heartbroken.

"He rang me the next day. I said, 'You know, I went over there waiting to visit you, darling.' He said, **'No one ever came near me.'**"

She pauses. "So who's telling lies there?"

This is what families experience when they're excluded from young people's care. Lies. Barriers. A black box where young people go in and come out worse.

"Cleveland really needs to be investigated," Aunty Corrine says quietly. "Because they're not doing the right thing by our children down there."

---

## The Isolation

"I got the voice but I got no backup."

This line haunts me.

Aunty Corrine has been blacklisted. "That's what I'm saying, I've got a black mark beside my name in the police station. That's when they picked me up. They more or less just about throw my licence back to me because that's how nasty they are."

She's been told to stop speaking up. Threatened with "getting in trouble."

But she keeps going. To meetings. To court. To hospitals and watch houses and schools.

At a recent public meeting for 54 Reasons (a youth service organization), she put her hand up.

"They're introducing people and they're pointing like this," she demonstrates. "I said, 'Excuse me, you need to tell all your workers to come to the front.' And then John [the director] gets up there introducing himself, and I said, 'Who were the people you spoke to in the community?'"

He said the PBC (traditional owner group).

"I said, 'But can you just repeat that?' I heard it, but I wanted everybody else to hear it."

The room erupted. People started walking out.

"Everybody was asking me, 'What did you rock the boat for?' I said, 'I never rocked no boat. I just asked a simple question. And there's no harm in asking.'"

---

## What Actually Works (And What Doesn't)

Aunty Corrine doesn't just critique. She knows what works. Because she's seen it.

**Voice of Peace (VOP):** A program that came through years ago. "They came out and I said, 'If you're looking for boys, come back tomorrow.' So they came back the next day. I pulled 15 boys out of the house. Out of the 15, she ended up with 6."

That's good numbers. The program was working.

"You know what? When I rang up about the program VOP, they lost the funding and it never happened again."

She shakes her head. "That VOP program should have been continuing still today, 2025. But because they've lost the funding, or government didn't want to fund it again. **Because you know when something start looking really good and deadly, you get the funding taken away. They don't want things to look great and good out here in Mount Isa.**"

**CASH (rehab centre):** Her dad built it. Her uncle ran it. "So over the years we had that many [Aboriginal people] there. When we had it, we had families walking away and people walking away with $20-30,000 in their bank accounts because we made sure that they had a life after CASH."

Then Salvation Army took over. "Them fellas out there, they're just ripping our mob off. They're picking and choosing. And it's costing them a fortune. So when we had it, people walked away with money. Now, nothing."

**Army pathways:** She worked for two years to get two boys into the Army. "It's really hard when people don't support wherever these children go. They're not supporting them and they're not making sure that they're still connecting back to family. Because it makes it hard for them for that isolation. They still need that family."

One young person, Ashton, made it into Army Reserves. "When he wore his uniform, he got teased that much that he went and burnt that uniform and never went back."

Lateral violence. "Big-noting yourself, you know. Who you trying to be? What you trying to make out?"

The program stopped supporting him. Community started tearing him down. He left.

"How do you keep empowering and strengthening our young people," Aunty Corrine asks, "when you haven't got these other people sitting in these ivory towers making out they're doing everything for our community, yet they're doing nothing for our community?"

---

## The Systems That Don't Talk

If there's one refrain in our conversation, it's this: **systems don't communicate**.

"You know how stupid the police are?" she asks. "They all work in different departments. Guess what? Big police station for nothing. **They don't work together.** So if I was in trouble and another police come out to look for me and the police that's dealing with me—they don't work together."

Child protection and police? Same story.

"Child safety wanted to send this little mum out to CASH [rehab] to work on her parenting. But they didn't realize there's a **no contact order in place** and the police had already put the partner out there. So why isn't child safety and everybody talking to each other?"

She throws her hands up. "Why would they say, 'Well, she can go out there for rehabilitation and then she might have the baby back by Christmas'—but the partner's out there? They're stupid fools. **See, just simple little things like that that they can't get right.**"

Services don't coordinate either. "Don't work with five service workers with one kid and they're missing the plan."

Meanwhile, Aunty Corrine coordinates across all of them. Police. Courts. Child protection. Housing. Mental health. Education.

Unpaid.

## The Professionals Who Learn From Her

The irony is not lost on Aunty Corrine.

"I've had a counsellor say to me, 'I could learn a lot from you.' This is a counsellor."

A few weeks later, she went to the hospital. "A counsellor went in for counselling. The counsellor ended up crying on her lap. And my sister went in there for counselling. The counsellor ended up on her lap. And my sister's giving her the tissue. When she came home she said, 'That was a waste of time. I was counseling the counselor.'"

Then the doctor. "I just like talking and the doctor put his pen down and he looked at me and he said, 'You know, I could learn a lot from you.' I'm thinking, well, this is real deadly. A doctor telling me and a counsellor telling me."

Professionals with university degrees learn from Aunty Corrine.

But she doesn't get a paycheck.

Let me say that again: **Professionals with university degrees learn from Aunty Corrine. But she doesn't get a paycheck.**

That's not an oversight. That's a choice.

---

## The Question

"I said to people, 'You know what, I work for every service, but I don't get paid for it.' I said, **'It's all from here'**"—she points to her heart.

This is the question at the heart of Australia's youth justice crisis:

**Why do we fund services that don't work—while community members who do the actual work labor for free?**

The economics are clear:
- Co-responders get close to $60/hour
- Case workers get $40-50/hour
- Housing workers get $35-45/hour
- Child safety workers get $40-60/hour

Aunty Corrine does all their jobs. Simultaneously. Better.

For $0/hour.

On a single day, 15 different services came to her house. "These boys sit here and they count the cars."

If you calculated Aunty Corrine's labor at professional rates—cross-system case coordination, crisis intervention, family support, advocacy—you'd be looking at **$800-1,200 per day**.

Multiply that by:
- 25 young people she's "taken on"
- 20+ years of this work
- Every other Aunty doing the same work across the country

We're talking about **millions of dollars** in unpaid community expertise subsidizing failed government systems.

## What Young People Actually Need

"At that meeting," Aunty Corrine recalls, "I just put my hand up and I said, 'Yeah, well, you know what? The saddest thing about all our little kids is **love and attention**.'"

She looks around Mount Isa. "I said, 'There's nothing here in Mount Isa. No parks for kids.'"

She's right. There are dog parks. Not kid parks.

"I said, 'Do I have to put my kids on leashes? Because there's more dog parks in this community than parks for kids.' And I said to the police, 'I can understand you running them over from that blue tarp in the park, but who gives you the right to tell all my kids to fuck off from the park?'"

Young people need:
- Love and attention
- Family connection
- Places to go that aren't watch houses
- Support that doesn't disappear when funding ends
- Adults who see their potential, not their "risk factors"

Aunty Corrine provides all of that. Has been for decades.

"As advocates in our community, that's why we got the bad name in the government. Because they're thinking, 'Oh, here we go, here she comes,' you know, all the time."

Good. Let them be uncomfortable.

---

## The Backup She Needs

"I got the voice but I got no backup."

So what would "backup" look like?

**Not more services.** We have enough services. Fifteen came to her house in one day, remember?

**Not more consultants.** Aunty Corrine is the expert. She doesn't need consultants to explain her community to her.

**Not short-term grants.** VOP worked. Then funding ended. CASH worked when Aboriginal-run. Then it got taken over.

**What Aunty Corrine needs—what all community advocates need—is:**

1. **Compensation for expertise** - Pay her what case managers get paid. She does their job better.

2. **Infrastructure to own knowledge** - A platform to document what works, what doesn't, who's accountable. Community-owned data.

3. **Legal protection** - Support when police retaliate, when services complain, when she's told to "stop running her mouth."

4. **Connection to other advocates** - The Aunties in Bourke, Moree, Alice Springs doing the same work. Collective power.

5. **Long-term investment** - Not 2-year grants. 10-year commitment to community infrastructure.

6. **Decision-making authority** - Not "consultation." Not "partnerships." **Governance.** Aunties at the table making decisions, not providing input others ignore.

This is what the NSW Government's Community Safety Investment Grant *could* fund. If they're serious about "community-led solutions."

But community-led doesn't mean community-consulted. It means **community-controlled.**

It means paying Aunty Corrine to do what she's already doing. And giving her the infrastructure to do it at scale.

---

## The Stakes

At the end of our conversation, Aunty Corrine says something that stays with me:

"At the end of the day, these kids need to know their history. Why they were removed. They need to know why they weren't able to be returned back to their family."

This is what's at stake. Not just "reducing offending." Not just "improving outcomes."

**Family. Culture. Truth. Accountability.**

Young people deserve to know why systems failed them. Families deserve to be part of solutions, not shut out. Communities deserve compensation for expertise, not extraction of knowledge.

And Aunties like Corrine deserve backup.

Not someday. Now.

---

## What You Can Do

**If you're a funder:**
- Ask which community members already do this work unpaid
- Fund their expertise, don't replicate it with services
- Commit to 10+ year investment in community infrastructure
- Support Aboriginal data sovereignty—communities own their knowledge

**If you're a service provider:**
- Learn from Aunties. Compensate them for teaching you.
- Advocate for integrated funding across departments
- Challenge your own organization when it "ticks and flicks"
- Position community members as experts, not "participants"

**If you're a policymaker:**
- Listen to Aunty Corrine's systems analysis. It's more sophisticated than most government reports.
- Fund what works (VOP, Aboriginal-run CASH, Youth Koori Court)
- Investigate Cleveland. Young people and families are telling you it's harmful.
- Raise the age of criminal responsibility. 10-year-olds don't belong in detention.

**If you're a community member:**
- You're not alone. Aunties across the country are doing this work.
- Your knowledge matters. Document it. Own it.
- Demand backup. You deserve compensation and support.
- Connect with others. Collective power is the only path to systems change.

## The Final Word

"Every meeting I go to, I always say that. And a lot of people say, 'Oh, you need to stop running your mouth or you're gonna get in trouble.'"

Aunty Corrine smiles. Not apologetically. Defiantly.

"I say, **'I don't care because it's our children that miss out.'**"

That's the voice we need to amplify.

Not silence.

Not "consult."

**Amplify. Compensate. Support. Follow.**

Because Aunty Corrine already knows what works.

We just need to get out of her way—and give her the resources to do it.
