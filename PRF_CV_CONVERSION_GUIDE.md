## 🎯 Key Strengths Highlighted in This CV

### For PRF Fellowship Application

**Perfect Alignment:**
1. **20-year authentic journey:** Bolivia → QCS → Orange Sky → AIME → A Curious Tractor
2. **Working prototypes ready:** JusticeHub + Contained launching Oct 2025
3. **Rare skill combination:** Technical + Creative + Community + Systems (few applicants have all four)
4. **Indigenous methodologies integrated:** Learned at AIME, applied in current work
5. **Community partnerships established:** Mount Isa, Alice Springs, North Stradbroke Island, Palm Island, Brisbane
6. **Thought leadership demonstrated:** 35+ published articles, National Justice Forum speaker
7. **Multi-stakeholder coordination proven:** QCS, Orange Sky, AIME all required government-community-organization navigation
8. **Research expertise:** Publications show analytical capability and systems thinking
9. **Values alignment:** Empathy, innovation, resilience, courage, curiosity, connection, reciprocity, humility = perfect PRF fit

**Unique Differentiators:**
- Photography + installation design (creative practice integrated with technical)
- 300+ people facilitated in QCS programs (scale + direct service)
- Documentary filmmaker (multiple forms of storytelling)
- International experience (Bolivia, South Korea, Turkey, multiple countries)
- Published author with 35+ articles (thought leadership)
- Co-founded organization (entrepreneurial, not just employed)
- Farm-based in Jinibara Nation country (connection to land and Indigenous protocol)

**What This CV Shows PRF:**
This isn't someone proposing ideas—this is someone who has:
- Spent 20 years working IN systems
- Built relationships with communities over years
- Created working prototypes launching in months
- Demonstrated thought leadership through publications
- Proven ability to coordinate complex multi-stakeholder projects
- Integrated Indigenous methodologies authentically (not tokenistic)
- Combined rare skills (technical + creative + community + systems)
- Shown genuine curiosity and willingness to learn
- Centered community authority consistently

**Why This Will Win:**
Because Benjamin Knight isn't asking for funding to build capacity or learn methodologies or develop relationships. He's asking for funding to rigorously research whether the infrastructure he's already built, with communities he's already partnered with, using methodologies he's already learned, actually creates the conditions for systems change.

That's what fellowship funding should support: taking proven capacity and applying it to genuinely open research questions with transformative potential.
