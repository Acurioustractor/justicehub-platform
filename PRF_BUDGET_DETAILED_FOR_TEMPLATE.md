## PART 1: PROJECT WORK BUDGET ($220,000)

### A. FELLOW TIME INVESTMENT: $110,000 (50% of project budget)

**Calculation:** 18 months @ ~70% FTE = ~$6,111 per month

**Time Allocation Breakdown:**

| Activity | Months | Hours/Week | Subtotal |
|----------|--------|------------|----------|
| Research Design & Ethics Approvals | 1-3 | 15-20 | $15,000 |

## BUDGET PRINCIPLES

### 1. Community Benefit First
**$90,000 (36% of total budget) flows directly to or for communities:**
- Contained hosting: $40,000
- JusticeHub platform: $30,000
- Community compensation: $20,000

Fellow time ($110,000) dedicated to working WITH communities as facilitator, not extracting FROM communities as researcher.

### 2. Research Period Sizing
All infrastructure investments sized for **18-month research and prototyping period**, not full-scale national implementation. If research demonstrates effectiveness, separate funding sought for scaling.

### 3. Economic Reciprocity
Community compensation ($20,000) is both ethical requirement AND core research question. Testing whether economic participation affects engagement, trust, agency, sustainability.

### 4. Transparency & Accountability
Budget ensures fellow accountable to:
- Communities (economic participation, consent, ownership)
- PRF (outcomes, learning, dissemination)
- Sector (methodology rigor, knowledge contribution)

### 5. Flexibility with Depth-Over-Breadth Commitment
If research requires prioritizing depth over breadth (3 communities deep analysis vs. 5 communities surface-level), budget allows reallocation:
- Fewer installation sites = deeper engagement per site
- Fewer organizations on platform = more training/support per organization
- Smaller participant numbers = richer qualitative data

## BUDGET NOTES FOR PRF TEMPLATE

### Host Organization Indirect Costs
**Not included in $250,000 budget.**

If fellowship requires host organization with indirect cost requirements:
- Negotiate separately with PRF
- Estimate <20% if required
- Preference: host organization that doesn't charge overheads OR PRF covers separately

### Budget Adjustments During Fellowship
Budget may be refined in collaboration with PRF if fellowship awarded, based on:
- Specific community partnerships finalized
- Timeline adjustments
- Emerging research needs
- PRF guidance

### Cash Flow Considerations
Suggest quarterly disbursements (4 payments over 18 months):
- Quarter 1 (Months 1-4): $70,000 (setup, baseline)
- Quarter 2 (Months 5-8): $60,000 (deep engagement)
- Quarter 3 (Months 9-12): $60,000 (testing hypotheses)
- Quarter 4 (Months 13-18): $60,000 (synthesis, dissemination)

### In-Kind Contributions (Not Requested from PRF)
Fellow brings existing infrastructure:
- JusticeHub platform foundation (already built)
- Contained installation foundation (already built)
- Community relationships (Mount Isa, Alice Springs, North Stradbroke Island, Palm Island, Brisbane)
- A Curious Tractor organizational support
- Photography equipment and creative practice expertise

PRF funding enables RESEARCH on infrastructure, not building infrastructure from scratch.
