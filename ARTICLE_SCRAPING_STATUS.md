## Technical Details

### API Credit Limitation

- **Status:** Anthropic API credits exhausted
- **Impact:** Cannot scrape remaining 29 articles until credits are replenished
- **Solution:** The comprehensive scraper (`scrape-all-articles.ts`) is ready to resume when credits available

### Scraper Features

‚úÖ Automatic pagination detection (scanned 5 pages)
‚úÖ Duplicate detection (won't re-scrape existing articles)
‚úÖ Rate limiting (3 seconds between requests)
‚úÖ Progress tracking
‚úÖ JSON and Markdown export
‚úÖ Error handling and retry logic

### Files Created

- **Scraper:** `src/scripts/scrape-all-articles.ts`
- **Article inventory:** `data/webflow-migration/all-article-slugs.txt`
- **Existing articles:** `data/webflow-migration/articles.json` (8 articles)
- **Markdown files:** `data/webflow-migration/articles-markdown/` (8 files)

## Next Steps

### When API Credits Available:

1. Run the comprehensive scraper:
   ```bash
   NODE_OPTIONS='--require dotenv/config' npx tsx src/scripts/scrape-all-articles.ts
   ```

2. Import all new articles:
   ```bash
   NODE_OPTIONS='--require dotenv/config' npx tsx src/scripts/import-articles-to-database.ts
   ```

3. Verify on frontend at http://localhost:3003/stories

### Alternative Approach (No API Credits Needed):

Manual scraping is possible but time-consuming:
- Visit each article URL
- Copy HTML content
- Manually convert to Markdown
- Add to articles.json

This would take ~2-3 hours for 29 articles.

## Content Themes Discovered

Based on the article titles, the content covers:

1. **Indigenous Justice** (Mount Isa, Central Australia, Mparntwe/Alice Springs)
2. **International Comparisons** (Spain's Diagrama model, European systems)
3. **Policy Analysis** (Queensland funding, government spending, legislation)
4. **Community Programs** (CONFIT, DeadlyLabs, Brodie Germaine, Richard Cassidy)
5. **Detention Center Reforms** (Bimberi, Resoleution program)
6. **Philosophical Perspectives** (Plato's Cave, power dynamics, entropy)
7. **Personal Stories** (Hamilton, Vic, Joe Kwon, Jackqwann)
