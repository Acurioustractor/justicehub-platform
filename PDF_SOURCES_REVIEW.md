## Data Collection Summary

### Successfully Extracting:
1. **Court Data**: Indigenous overrepresentation percentages, age demographics, sentencing outcomes
2. **Police Data**: Regional crime statistics, repeat offender rates, offense categories
3. **Budget Data**: Funding allocations, infrastructure spending, program costs
4. **Detention Data**: Population numbers, demographics, length of stay
5. **Audit Data**: Spending analysis, accountability gaps, system performance

### Update Frequencies:
- **Annual**: Court reports, police statistics, budget papers, AIHW reports
- **Quarterly**: Youth detention census
- **Monthly**: Some police statistics (via online portal)
- **Irregular**: Parliamentary papers, audit reports, research studies

## Identified Gaps and Recommendations

### 1. Missing Sources We Should Add:

#### a) Inspector of Detention Services Reports
- Queensland's Inspector of Detention Services publishes critical reports on youth detention conditions
- Would provide: Detention conditions, use of force data, isolation statistics

#### b) Childrens Court Magistrates Association Reports
- Annual reports on systemic issues in youth justice
- Would provide: Magistrate perspectives, court process inefficiencies

#### c) Queensland Human Rights Commission
- Youth justice system reviews and investigations
- Would provide: Human rights violations, systemic discrimination data

#### d) Office of the Public Guardian
- Reports on children in state care entering youth justice
- Would provide: Care-to-custody pipeline data

### 2. Data Quality Issues:

1. **PDF Accessibility**: Some PDFs are scanned images rather than text, making extraction difficult
2. **Inconsistent Formats**: Budget papers change format year-to-year
3. **Delayed Publishing**: Some annual reports published 6-12 months after period ends
4. **Incomplete Data**: Some reports redact or aggregate data to protect privacy

### 3. Technical Recommendations:

1. **Implement PDF validation**: Check if PDFs are text-based before processing
2. **Add fallback sources**: When PDFs fail, try HTML versions
3. **Version tracking**: Monitor when agencies update their PDFs
4. **Historical archive**: Store copies of PDFs as agencies sometimes remove old reports

## Conclusion

The Queensland Youth Justice Tracker successfully extracts data from 8 major PDF source categories, covering courts, police, treasury, audit office, detention statistics, and research bodies. The system captures critical accountability metrics including:

- Indigenous youth comprising 86% of 10-11 year olds in court
- 20x Indigenous overrepresentation in the justice system
- $1.38 billion in youth justice spending
- 470 children held in adult watch houses

To enhance data coverage, we should add Inspector of Detention Services reports, Human Rights Commission findings, and Public Guardian statistics. The current extraction system using Firecrawl successfully processes most government PDFs, though some older scanned documents may require OCR capabilities.
