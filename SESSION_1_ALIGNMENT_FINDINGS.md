## 🎯 The Ask - Budget Alignment Analysis

### THREE_SCENARIOS_BUDGET.md (MOST DETAILED & RECENT)

| Scenario | 3-Year Total | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Communities | Indigenous Developers |
|----------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **LEAN** | **$5.9M** | $1.8M | $2.0M | $2.1M | 4 | 2 → paid staff |
| **BASE** ⭐ | **$10.5M** | $3.1M | $3.6M | $3.8M | 6 | 4 → paid staff |
| **UPPER** | **$17.6M** | $4.6M | $6.1M | $6.9M | 10 (6→8→10) | 6 → paid staff |

**Recommendation:** **BASE ($10.5M)** for meaningful systems change

### MINDAROO_STRATEGIC_PITCH.md

| Level | 3-Year Range | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|-------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Level 1** | **$5.2M - $7.1M** | $1.4M-$1.9M | $1.8M-$2.4M | $2.0M-$2.8M |
| **Level 2** ⭐ | **$9.5M - $13.0M** | $2.8M-$3.6M | $3.2M-$4.5M | $3.5M-$4.9M |
| **Level 3** | **$17.5M - $22.5M** | $5.0M-$6.2M | $6.5M-$8.5M | $6.0M-$7.8M |

**Recommendation:** **Level 2 ($9.5M-$13.0M)** - Foundational Excellence

**Key Details:**
- $1.08M annually for 6 communities at $180K each (proper compensation at consultant rates)
- A Curious Tractor overhead: $320-395K annually (~11-12%)
- Budget revision note: October 2025 upward revision for proper community compensation

### MINDAROO_ONE_PAGER.md ⚠️

| Scenario | 3-Year Range | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|----------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Minimal** | **$4M - $5.6M** | | | |
| **Foundational** ⭐ | **$7.5M - $10.5M** | $2.0M - $2.8M | $2.5M - $3.5M | $2.8M - $4.0M |
| **Comprehensive** | **$13M - $17M** | | | |

**Recommendation:** **Foundational ($7.5M-$10.5M)** - Level 2

**Key Details from ONE_PAGER:**
- 6 communities engagement
- 4-5 Indigenous developers/producers trained
- 20% cost reduction by Year 3
- $50-100K revenue by Year 3
- 60-70% self-sustaining by Year 5

---

## ⚠️ DISCREPANCIES IDENTIFIED

### **Critical: Budget Range Misalignment**

**Issue:** The ONE_PAGER uses a lower budget range than the STRATEGIC_PITCH

**Details:**
- **ONE_PAGER:** $7.5M - $10.5M (Foundational/Level 2)
- **STRATEGIC_PITCH:** $9.5M - $13.0M (Level 2)
- **THREE_SCENARIOS:** $10.5M (BASE - specific amount)

**Analysis:**
- $10.5M (BASE) fits within STRATEGIC_PITCH range ($9.5M-$13.0M) ✅
- $10.5M (BASE) is at the HIGH END of ONE_PAGER range ($7.5M-$10.5M) ⚠️
- ONE_PAGER appears to use pre-October 2025 budget figures
- STRATEGIC_PITCH explicitly notes "Budget Revision Note (October 2025)" with upward revision

**Root Cause:**
The October 2025 budget revision increased Level 2 costs to account for:
1. Proper community compensation ($180K per community vs token stipends)
2. Explicit A Curious Tractor organizational capacity (11-12% overhead)
3. Business development capacity from Year 2

**✅ RECOMMENDATION:**
**Update MINDAROO_ONE_PAGER.md** to use the revised budget range:
- Change from: $7.5M - $10.5M
- Change to: **$9.5M - $13.0M** (or use specific **$10.5M** from BASE scenario)
- Update Year 1 from $2.0M-$2.8M to **$2.8M-$3.6M**

---

### **Minor: Indigenous Developer Numbers Discrepancy**

**Issue:** Different trainee numbers in Year 1 for Level 2/BASE scenario

**Details:**
- **THREE_SCENARIOS BASE:** 2 trainees in Year 1 → scales to 4 by Year 2-3 → 4 paid developers by Year 3
- **STRATEGIC_PITCH Level 2:** "4-5 young Indigenous trainees"
- **ONE_PAGER:** "4-5 Indigenous developers/producers trained"

**Analysis:**
- THREE_SCENARIOS approach is more realistic: Start with 2, scale to 4
- Other documents may be citing the Year 3 outcome (4 paid developers) rather than Year 1 trainees
- Or they're describing total trainees across 3 years rather than Year 1 specifically

**✅ RECOMMENDATION:**
**Clarify the progression** in all documents:
- Year 1: **2 trainees** (realistic startup)
- Year 2: **4 trainees** (scaled up)
- Year 3: **4 paid Indigenous developers** (trainees become staff)
- Use language like "training and employing 4 Indigenous developers over 3 years"

---

### **Minor: Sustainability Percentage by Year 5**

**Issue:** ONE_PAGER mentions a Year 5 sustainability target not found in other documents

**Details:**
- **ONE_PAGER:** "60-70% self-sustaining by Year 5"
- **STRATEGIC_PITCH:** Not explicitly stated for Level 2
- **THREE_SCENARIOS:** Shows progressive revenue growth but no Year 5 percentage

**✅ RECOMMENDATION:**
**Add the Year 5 sustainability target** to STRATEGIC_PITCH and THREE_SCENARIOS for consistency:
- "60-70% self-sustaining by Year 5" (reduces philanthropic dependency)
- This aligns with the broader narrative about breaking dependency cycles

---

## ✅ ALIGNED ELEMENTS (No Changes Needed)

### **1. Problem Statement** 🟢

1. **Update MINDAROO_ONE_PAGER.md budget figures**
   - [ ] Change Level 2 from $7.5M-$10.5M to **$9.5M-$13.0M** (or use specific **$10.5M**)
   - [ ] Update Year 1 budget from $2.0M-$2.8M to **$2.8M-$3.6M**
   - [ ] Update Year 2 budget from $2.5M-$3.5M to **$3.2M-$4.5M**
   - [ ] Update Year 3 budget from $2.8M-$4.0M to **$3.5M-$4.9M**
   - [ ] Add note: "Budget revised October 2025 for proper community compensation"

2. **Clarify Indigenous developer progression across all documents**
   - [ ] Use consistent language: "Training 2 developers in Year 1, scaling to 4 paid Indigenous developers by Year 3"
   - [ ] Avoid ambiguity about Year 1 vs 3-year totals

3. **Add Year 5 sustainability target to STRATEGIC_PITCH and THREE_SCENARIOS**
   - [ ] Add: "60-70% self-sustaining by Year 5"
   - [ ] Explain revenue model progression: Year 3 ($60K) → Year 5 (60-70% self-sustaining)

---

### 🟡 **Medium Priority (Enhance Messaging):**

4. **Add flywheel description to alignment check**
   - [ ] Verify 6 steps are identical across all documents
   - [ ] Ensure visual metaphor is described consistently
   - [ ] *[Deferred to next task - will review flywheel descriptions]*

5. **Create single source of truth for key statistics**
   - [ ] Standardize incarceration disparity statistics
   - [ ] Standardize cost-of-detention figures
   - [ ] Ensure all documents cite same evidence sources

6. **Enhance budget narrative in ONE_PAGER**
   - [ ] Explain why Level 2 budget increased (proper compensation, not token stipends)
   - [ ] Add transparency about A Curious Tractor overhead (11-12%)
   - [ ] Show direct community investment ($3.52M to communities over 3 years for BASE)

---

### 🟢 **Low Priority (Nice to Have):**

7. **Standardize naming conventions**
   - Consider whether to use "Level 1/2/3", "Minimal/Foundational/Comprehensive", or "LEAN/BASE/UPPER"
   - Current mixed naming works but could be streamlined

8. **Add visual callouts for revised budget**
   - Explain October 2025 revision in simple terms
   - Show value proposition: More investment = Fair compensation + Better outcomes

---

## 📊 Recommended Budget Scenario for Mindaroo

Based on review:

**✅ RECOMMENDATION: BASE / Level 2 / Foundational**

**Amount:** **$10.5M over 3 years**
- Year 1: $3.1M
- Year 2: $3.6M
- Year 3: $3.8M (net of $60K revenue)

**Range for flexibility:** $9.5M - $13.0M (allows negotiation within bounds)

**Rationale:**

1. **Meaningful systems change** - LEAN is too small to demonstrate full model; UPPER may be too ambitious for Mindaroo's risk appetite
2. **6 communities** provides national representation without overextending
3. **Quality platform** that's community-ready, not just functional MVP
4. **Realistic capacity building** - 2→4 Indigenous developers is achievable
5. **Revenue pilot** demonstrates sustainability pathway
6. **International connections** (NZ + Canada delegations) bring global best practice
7. **Cost per community ($1.75M over 3 years)** is fair for deep partnership, not token engagement
8. **Direct community investment ($3.52M)** shows proper valuation of Indigenous knowledge
9. **Clear path to ownership** - governance structures operational by Year 3, transfer by Year 5

**This is the "Goldilocks" scenario** - not too small to prove the model, not so large it's overwhelming. It's the scenario that best demonstrates transformational philanthropy (building permanent community infrastructure) vs transactional funding (ongoing program support).

## 📌 Key Insights from This Review

### **What's Working Well:**

1. **Strong, consistent narrative** about community ownership and data sovereignty
2. **Clear differentiation** from other platforms (true ownership, not just "community-led")
3. **Evidence of work already done** ($303K pre-investment value demonstrates momentum)
4. **Realistic cost reduction** via Indigenous capacity building (20% by Year 3)
5. **Revenue model** breaks philanthropic dependency (60-70% self-sustaining by Year 5)

### **What Needs Attention:**

1. **Budget range alignment** - ONE_PAGER needs October 2025 revision update
2. **Trainee progression clarity** - Specify "2 in Year 1 → 4 by Year 3"
3. **Year 5 sustainability target** - Add to all documents for consistency

### **Strategic Positioning:**

JusticeHub is **not a platform**, it's **community infrastructure**. Mindaroo is being asked to invest in:
- Permanent asset that outlives philanthropic funding
- Economic self-determination for Indigenous communities
- Legal transfer of ownership to community-governed ACCO
- Knowledge sovereignty backed by enforceable legal and technical controls
- Multiplier effect (their dollars create ongoing community revenue)

This is **transformational philanthropy**, not transactional funding.

---

**Status:** ✅ SESSION 1 COMPLETE

**Next:** Session 2 - Create Sovereignty Flywheel visual in Figma

**Questions/Concerns:** None - documents are well-aligned overall, just need minor budget updates

**Confidence Level:** 🟢 HIGH - Ready to move forward with BASE ($10.5M) pitch to Mindaroo
