## üìä Data Extraction Process

### Current Method (Manual Verification)
1. Download PDF from official source
2. Extract text using pdf-parse
3. Manually verify key statistics
4. Cross-reference with previous years
5. Store in structured JSON format
6. Load into database with full attribution

### Automated Pipeline (In Development)
```javascript
// Example extraction pattern for court data
const patterns = {
  totalDefendants: {
    regex: /total.*defendants.*?(\d{1,5})/i,
    page: 15,
    verification: value => value > 5000 && value < 15000
  },
  indigenousRate: {
    regex: /indigenous.*?(\d{1,3}\.?\d*)%/i,
    page: 18,
    verification: value => value > 50 && value < 90
  }
}
```
