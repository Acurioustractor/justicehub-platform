# üèõÔ∏è Justice Reinvestment Sites - Import Complete

## Overview

Successfully created infrastructure to import **37 Justice Reinvestment sites** from the Paul Ramsay Foundation portfolio across Australia. These are critical community-led programs that address the root causes of crime and reduce incarceration rates.

## What is Justice Reinvestment?

Justice Reinvestment is a data-driven approach that redirects criminal justice spending from prisons to community-based programs that address the underlying causes of crime. It's particularly impactful for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who are over-represented in the justice system.
