## Your CONTAINED Blog Post

I've written a complete draft in `blog-drafts/contained-launch.md`:

**Title**: "Building Revolution in Shipping Containers: The Story of CONTAINED"

**Key Sections**:
1. The Problem We Can't Unsee (stats on detention vs. programs)
2. What is CONTAINED? (immersive campaign experience)
3. Why Shipping Containers? (metaphor for containment)
4. The Revolution Happens at the Intersection
5. What's Inside CONTAINED? (the 4 rooms)
6. This is Not a Gallery Piece (call to action)
7. The Builders (you and Nicholas)

**Features to Add**:
- Photos of the CONTAINED installation
- Video walk-through
- Links to Benjamin Knight and Nicholas Marchesi profiles

## What Makes This System Special

### 1. **Content Integration**
Unlike a typical blog, your posts can:
- Link directly to people's profiles
- Reference specific programs
- Connect to services
- Showcase art projects
- Everything is interconnected

### 2. **Evidence-Based**
Blog posts can include:
- Data from your platform
- Success rates from programs
- Real stories from young people
- Financial comparisons

### 3. **Action-Oriented**
Every post can include:
- Direct links to programs
- Calls to action
- Ways to get involved
- Evidence of what works

## Next Actions

**Let me know which you'd like first**:

1. **Build the Editor** - Rich text interface to write/edit posts
2. **Import CONTAINED Post** - Get your first post live
3. **Public Blog Pages** - Display posts on the site
4. **Image Upload System** - Add photos to posts
5. **Content Linking UI** - Tag people/programs easily

I recommend we:
1. Import the CONTAINED post (5 min)
2. Build the public display (10 min)

Then you'll have your first blog post published and can see how it all works!
