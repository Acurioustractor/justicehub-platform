**Subject**: API Access Request - JusticeHub Queensland Youth Justice Directory

---

## Email Body

Dear Infoxchange Team,

I am reaching out on behalf of **JusticeHub**, a community-driven platform dedicated to connecting young people in Queensland's youth justice system with appropriate support services.

### About JusticeHub

JusticeHub is an open-source, non-profit initiative that aims to create the most comprehensive directory of youth justice services in Queensland. Our mission is to improve outcomes for young people by ensuring they can easily discover and access the services they need.

**Current Status**:
- **511 services** in our database (growing rapidly from 32 services two weeks ago)
- Focus on Queensland youth justice services with national context
- Coverage spans: mental health, housing, legal aid, cultural support, family support, court diversion, education/training, and more
- 14 specialized service categories tailored to youth justice needs
- **83% well-categorized** services with AI-enhanced categorization
- National coverage of Justice Reinvestment sites (18 proven community-led models)
- Integration with government youth justice programs across all Australian states
- Open-source platform built with modern web technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL)

### Why We're Reaching Out

We would like to explore access to your **Service Seeker API** to significantly accelerate our growth and improve data quality:

1. **Expand coverage**: Your directory contains 2,000-5,000+ Queensland community services that would be immediately valuable to our users
2. **Improve contact completeness**: Currently only 11% of our services have complete contact information - your API would dramatically improve this
3. **Maintain accuracy**: Access to regularly updated information ensures our users always have current service details
4. **Fill geographic gaps**: Many regional Queensland services are likely in your database
5. **Build on existing work**: Rather than duplicate efforts, we want to complement your comprehensive directory with youth justice specialization

### What Makes JusticeHub Unique

Unlike general service directories, JusticeHub provides:

- **Youth justice specialization**: 14 categories specifically relevant to young people in the justice system
- **Evidence-based context**: Links to research, Justice Reinvestment models, and best practices
- **Justice Reinvestment focus**: Integration with 18 proven community-led alternatives to incarceration
- **Government integration**: Official youth justice programs from all Australian states
- **National perspective**: Connects Queensland services to broader youth justice reform movement
- **Modern UX**: Built with latest web technologies for excellent mobile experience
- **Geographic intelligence**: Location-based discovery to connect young people with nearby services

### Our Ask

We are interested in:

1. **API access** to query Queensland youth justice and community support services
2. **Non-profit pricing** appropriate for a community initiative (we understand commercial API pricing may not be feasible for us at current scale)
3. **Partnership opportunities** to contribute data back to your platform

We're open to exploring various arrangements:
- Full API access with rate limiting
- Subset access (Queensland youth-relevant services only)
- Periodic data dumps with attribution
- Co-branding (e.g., "JusticeHub powered by Infoxchange data")

### Technical Implementation

Our platform is built with:
- **Next.js 15** (React framework)
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL database)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Modern API integration patterns**

We would implement your API following best practices:
- **Proper attribution** and prominent links back to Service Seeker
- **Responsible rate limiting** (10,000-50,000 calls/month initially)
- **Smart caching** to minimize API load (24-hour cache for stable data)
- **Batch synchronization** where appropriate
- **Error handling and fallbacks**
- **Usage monitoring and reporting**

### Community Impact

The integration would enable us to:

- **Reach more young people** in need of diversionary support
- **Reduce service discovery friction** for youth justice workers and case managers
- **Improve service utilization** by better connecting young people with appropriate services
- **Support evidence-based practice** by providing comprehensive options
- **Demonstrate impact** of Justice Reinvestment and community-led models
- **Fill critical gap** in Queensland youth justice service discovery

### Why This Matters Now

Queensland has committed to significant youth justice reform, including:
- Youth Justice Strategy 2019-2023 and beyond
- Focus on diversion and community-based alternatives
- Investment in cultural support and Indigenous-led programs
- Justice Reinvestment pilot sites

**But young people and workers struggle to discover available services.** JusticeHub directly addresses this gap, and your API would accelerate our ability to help.

### Real-World Use Cases

With comprehensive service data, JusticeHub would enable:

1. **Youth justice workers**: Quickly find appropriate referral options for young clients
2. **Young people**: Self-discover support services in their local area
3. **Families**: Connect with family support and cultural programs
4. **Courts**: Identify community-based alternatives for sentencing
5. **Researchers**: Analyze service availability and gaps by region/category
6. **Policy makers**: Understand service landscape for planning and investment

### Next Steps

We would appreciate the opportunity to:

1. **Discuss API access options** and pricing appropriate for our non-profit model
2. **Review integration requirements** and documentation
3. **Explore data contribution** - how we can give back to Infoxchange
4. **Schedule a brief call** to discuss partnership opportunities (30 minutes)

### Our Commitment

If we proceed with integration, we commit to:

- **Prominent attribution**: "Service data provided by Infoxchange"
- **Direct links**: Every service links back to authoritative source on Service Seeker
- **Responsible usage**: Caching, rate limiting, monitoring
- **Data quality feedback**: Report issues we identify
- **Promotion**: Promote Infoxchange as a trusted partner
- **Regular reporting**: Share usage metrics and impact data

### Technical Contact

I'm available for a technical discussion about integration patterns, data models, and implementation timelines.

Thank you for considering our request. Infoxchange's mission to connect people with community services aligns perfectly with JusticeHub's youth justice focus. Together, we can significantly improve service discovery for one of Australia's most vulnerable populations.

We look forward to exploring how we can work together to improve outcomes for young people in Queensland's youth justice system.

## Key Talking Points if They Call

1. **Non-commercial**: Emphasize community benefit, not commercial goals
2. **Complementary**: Youth justice specialization vs their general directory
3. **Attribution**: Commit to prominent attribution and linking
4. **Technical**: Show we can integrate responsibly with caching/rate limiting
5. **Queensland focus**: Geographic specificity makes this more manageable
6. **Proven traction**: 511 services in 2 weeks shows execution capability
7. **Impact potential**: Direct connection to youth justice reform efforts
8. **Flexible**: Open to various arrangements (API, data dumps, co-branding)

## Expected API Costs (Be Prepared to Discuss)

Based on typical SaaS API pricing:

- **Best case**: Non-profit tier - $0-200/month for 50,000 calls
- **Standard**: $500-1,000/month for commercial API access
- **Enterprise**: $2,000+/month for unlimited access

**Our position**:
- Start small (10,000 calls/month)
- Implement aggressive caching (reduce to maybe 1,000 actual API calls)
- Grow with usage
- Explore data partnership if API pricing is prohibitive

## Alternative if API Access is Denied

1. **One-time data export**: Request Queensland youth services as CSV
2. **Partnership model**: Co-develop youth justice service taxonomy
3. **Attribution-only**: Link to Service Seeker for full details
4. **Continue manual curation**: Focus on quality over quantity
