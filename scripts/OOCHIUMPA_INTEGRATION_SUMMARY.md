## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 2)

### 1. Build AI Source Discovery Using Oochiumpa Patterns

**Create**: `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/scripts/alma-source-discovery.mjs`

**Oochiumpa Pattern Learning**:
- Keywords: "on-country", "cultural connection", "holistic youth support", "family healing"
- Outcomes: School re-engagement, offending reduction, cultural reconnection
- Structure: Community-owned, Elder-involved, wraparound support
- Location: Remote/regional NT (not urban)

**AI Discovery Task**:
```javascript
async discoverSimilarPrograms(exemplar) {
  // Use Oochiumpa as exemplar
  // Search for programs with similar:
  // - Keywords (cultural, holistic, community-led)
  // - Outcomes (school, offending, wellbeing)
  // - Structure (Aboriginal-controlled, Elder-involved)
  // - Location (remote/regional focus)
}
```

**Target**: Find 5-10 programs similar to Oochiumpa in NT

### 2. NT Baseline Government Scraping

**Sources**:
- NT Royal Commission reports (public domain)
- AIHW Youth Justice 2023-24 reports
- Productivity Commission ROGS 2025
- Parliamentary inquiry transcripts (NT focus)

**Look for**: References to programs like Oochiumpa (may be unnamed in government reports)

### 3. Aboriginal Partnership Outreach

## ✅ Success Metrics Achieved

- ✅ **1 Aboriginal-owned intervention** integrated as foundation
- ✅ **6 proven outcomes** documented (quantitative + qualitative)

- ✅ **17 stories** cross-referenced from Empathy Ledger
- ✅ **100% consent compliance** (Community Controlled level)
- ✅ **10% revenue sharing** operational

## 🔥 Strategic Shift

### Old Approach
"Government scraping → Community enrichment → Funder intelligence"

### New Approach
"**Oochiumpa Aboriginal intelligence (already trusted) → AI pattern learning → Similar program discovery → Community partnerships → Shared intelligence → Funder revenue**"

### Why This Matters
- Builds trust with Aboriginal organizations from day 1
- Centers Aboriginal knowledge and authority
- Uses AI for discovery (finding similar programs), not extraction
- Revenue flows back to community knowledge contributors
- Demonstrates value to communities BEFORE selling to funders

---

## 🎉 Philosophy Realized

From `/Users/benknight/act-global-infrastructure/act-personal-ai/ACT_DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md`:

### Cultural Sovereignty is Sacred
✅ OCAP enforced in code via consent ledger, not just docs
✅ Community Controlled consent level with revocation capability
✅ Revenue sharing (10%) embedded in system

### Observe Systems, Never Optimize People
✅ Track programs and interventions, not individual youth
✅ Outcomes documented at program level
✅ Stories maintain privacy through Empathy Ledger control

### Hard Blocks Over Soft Warnings
✅ Aboriginal data consent REQUIRED (enforced in database constraints)
✅ Cultural authority field mandatory for Community Controlled interventions
✅ Revenue sharing tracked in consent record

### Regenerative Over Extractive
✅ Revenue sharing (10% to Aboriginal knowledge contributors)
✅ Community benefit (Intelligence Pack helps Aboriginal orgs find funding)
✅ Knowledge flows both ways (Oochiumpa insights → AI discovery → more Aboriginal programs found)
