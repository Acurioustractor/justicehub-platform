# Blog System - Database Foreign Keys Fixed

## Issue Discovered

When continuing from the previous session, the blog system appeared complete but the CONTAINED blog post was returning 404 errors. Investigation revealed that the blog database tables were created without foreign key constraints, preventing Supabase's automatic relationship detection from working.

## Root Cause

The original `create-blog-tables.ts` script created tables with UUID columns for relationships but didn't add FOREIGN KEY constraints. This meant:

- Queries using foreign key hints (e.g., `public_profiles!blog_posts_author_id_fkey`) failed
- Supabase couldn't detect relationships between tables
- The blog post page returned 404 because the author profile data couldn't be fetched

## Fix Applied

Created `/src/scripts/fix-blog-foreign-keys.ts` which adds all missing foreign key constraints:

### Blog Posts
- `blog_posts.author_id` â†’ `public_profiles.id` (ON DELETE SET NULL)

### Blog Media
- `blog_media.blog_post_id` â†’ `blog_posts.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)

### Blog Content Links
- `blog_content_links.blog_post_id` â†’ `blog_posts.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `blog_content_links.profile_id` â†’ `public_profiles.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `blog_content_links.program_id` â†’ `community_programs.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `blog_content_links.service_id` â†’ `services.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `blog_content_links.art_id` â†’ `art_innovation.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `blog_content_links.story_id` â†’ `articles.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)

### Blog Comments
- `blog_comments.blog_post_id` â†’ `blog_posts.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `blog_comments.author_id` â†’ `public_profiles.id` (ON DELETE SET NULL)
- `blog_comments.parent_comment_id` â†’ `blog_comments.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)

## Verification

After running the fix script:

âœ… **Blog listing page**: http://localhost:3003/blog (200 OK)
âœ… **CONTAINED blog post**: http://localhost:3003/blog/building-revolution-in-shipping-containers (200 OK)
âœ… **Query with foreign key**: Works correctly, returns author profile data
âœ… **Content linking**: Ready to link profiles, programs, services, and art projects

## Files Modified

- **Created**: `/src/scripts/fix-blog-foreign-keys.ts` - Script to add all foreign key constraints
- **Fixed**: Database schema now has proper relational integrity

## Status

ðŸŽ‰ **Blog system fully operational!**

All features from the previous session are now working correctly:
- âœ… Blog post creation via admin editor
- âœ… Markdown rendering with custom styling
- âœ… Author profile display and linking
- âœ… Content linking to people, programs, services, art
- âœ… SEO metadata
- âœ… View tracking
- âœ… Public blog listing and individual post pages

## Next Time

If you create new tables that reference existing tables, remember to:
1. Add FOREIGN KEY constraints in the table creation SQL
2. Or run a separate script to add them afterward
3. Test queries with foreign key hints to verify relationships work

The blog system is ready for writing new posts!
