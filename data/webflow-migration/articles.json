    "content": "The red dust of Mount Isa carries stories. In every particle that rises with the morning wind, there are memories of connection, rupture, and the profound work of mending. Here, in this mining town where the earth has been opened and scarred, a different kind of excavation is taking place - one that unearths pathways to healing rather than ore.\n\nAt 7 AM, the community gathers at Outback at Isa. By 9 AM, they're marching - a river of bodies moving through streets that have witnessed so much. NAIDOC week in Mount Isa isn't just ceremony; it's a annual reckoning, a visible reminder that despite everything, community endures.\n\nIn this crowd, Brodie Germaine walks surrounded by the constellation of relationships that define him. Uncle Warren King, Kalkadoon Elder and family friend, watches with eyes that have seen generations pass. \"This fellow here, I'm very proud of it,\" Uncle Warren says, his words carrying the weight of cultural approval. \"He is doing that as a young man. With his own business and his involvement in community has been staunch strong and resilient as well.\"\n\nThe pride in Uncle Warren's voice speaks to something deeper than individual achievement. \"He comes from good stock, so to speak, and he'll continue.\" In these words lies the Indigenous understanding of success - not as individual triumph but as continuation, as the passing forward of responsibility and care.\n\n\"I've never missed a march no matter where I am on whatever side of the country,\" one community member shares, \"I'll find where the NAIDOC March is and attend.\" This gravitational pull toward community gathering reveals how culture survives - through the conscious choice to return, to be present, to bear witness.\n\nFor Brodie, who has marched since he was \"knee high to a grasshopper,\" the route from Outback at Isa to the Civic Center maps more than physical distance. It traces his journey from a young boy stealing from houses to a man who Uncle Warren observes with admiration: \"And you're doing that with the gym? I love that. I love the Facebook page. I love the way he said the young fellas that go there how they man up is deadly, you know?\"\n\nThe transformation Uncle Warren celebrates isn't about leaving community but about returning to it differently. Where once Brodie took, now he gives. Where once he ran from police, now he invites them to join camping trips as human beings rather than enforcers.\n\nWalking beside Brodie is Danielle Germaine, his mother, whose presence illuminates the deeper roots of his work. \"Something you taught us since we were babies is to be proud of who we are, our culture,\" Brodie tells her during the march. Her response carries the quiet strength of mothers who have held families together against impossible odds: \"I think we just got to keep going, be resilient and not to give up. Even though at times where we think we can't do enough for these kids, we just gotta keep trying so they know that they've got someone there to listen out and look out for.\"\n\nThe intergenerational dialogue continues as Brodie reflects: \"Unfortunately I was part of youth crime growing up and I'm, now, I'm in a position giving back. I learned that from you and dad.\" This admission, made public during NAIDOC, transforms shame into testimony, wound into wisdom.\n\nAs the march progresses, the tapestry of Brodie's impact reveals itself through multiple voices. Nigel Tain, from the Men's Rugby Union, speaks with the authority of someone who has witnessed transformation firsthand: \"We collaborated with Brodie last year to do a bit on country stuff. You know, we went to the Gregory and to Lake Julius a couple of times and to see the growth in the kids... Bode does an absolute amazing job for the community.\"\n\nThe young people walking nearby offer their own testimonies, simpler but no less profound. \"Just stay with Brodie 'cause he's been through it and we just wanna do good in life,\" one shares. Another adds, \"He keeps us away from trouble, you know?\" Their words reveal the alchemy of authentic mentorship - how lived experience, when transformed through healing, becomes medicine for others.\n\n\"I'd rather Brodie here 'cause it's face to face,\" a young person explains, speaking to the irreplaceable value of presence, of someone who doesn't judge from distance but stands alongside in the difficult work of choosing differently.\n\nBrodie's little brother Rashad performs with the Kalkadoon Sundowners, the dance troupe bringing culture alive through movement. \"Watching you grow up from a young age. Now you're taller than me, brother,\" Brodie observes with pride. The exchange between brothers - one who found his path through fitness and mentorship, another through cultural dance - speaks to the multiple ways healing happens in community.\n\n\"Get more people into this stuff, tell 'em to come dance,\" Rashad suggests when asked about supporting young people. \"Let them show them their culture. Like, let 'em open up.\" His words echo his brother's philosophy - that connection to culture, whether through traditional dance or modern fitness, offers young people ways to inhabit their bodies and spirits differently.\n\nThroughout the march, a deeper pattern emerges. Person after person speaks not just of Brodie's individual work but of how he fits into a larger ecosystem of care. Uncle George, another Elder working in schools, shares his approach: \"You'll see a lot of little kids that walk around the streets... Pull 'em up and have a chat. What I've done, I went around and I just introduced myself to by showing myself out there with the kids.\"\n\nThis methodology - presence over surveillance, relationship over control - runs through every successful intervention in Mount Isa. As Uncle George notes about his work: \"We've got some kids back there that haven't been to school for years and now they're enjoying it... because the thing is I get 'em together.\"\n\nFor Brodie, walking in this march carrying the hopes and trust of so many, the weight is palpable. Each person who stops to share their story, each young person who looks to him for guidance, each Elder who nods approval - they're all threads in a web of accountability that Indigenous leadership understands intimately.\n\n\"NAIDOC means when everyone comes together,\" one youth worker reflects, but in Mount Isa, it means something more specific: witnessing Brodie and others like him transform their struggles into service, their wounds into wisdom, their individual healing into community medicine.\n\nAs the crowd reaches the Civic Center, children run between adults' legs, Elders sit in the shade sharing stories, young people eye each other shyly across cultural divides. The formal march ends but the real work continues - in gyms where young bodies learn their own power, on Country where ancient knowledge finds new vessels, in the daily choice to show up for each other.\n\n\"What does NAIDOC mean to you?\" becomes a refrain throughout the day. For Brodie, the answer lives not in words but in practice: \"We live culture every day from a young age until now... culture to me is whether it's you, how we practice our culture in different ways. A lot of us go hunting, fishing, being around family. I think the main keys with culture is family, community, and always, you know, we always look out for one another.\"\n\n## The Continuum\n\nUncle Warren's opening words echo as the day progresses: \"NAIDOC is a legacy that our ancestors and our Elders before us have built for us to carry forward... Our young leaders coming through to take up the fight for us and keeping the fires burning for us.\"\n\nIn Brodie Germaine, the community sees this prophecy made flesh. Not perfect - he's the first to share his struggles, his ongoing journey of healing - but present, accountable, transformed and transforming. The young people who gravitate to him, who find in his gym and his camping programs a different vision of their own possibilities, are the living proof of what becomes possible when communities nurture their own solutions.\n\nAs the sun sets on another NAIDOC march, as families return home and the streets empty of ceremony, the real work continues. In every young person who chooses the gym over the streets, in every Elder whose wisdom finds willing ears, in every moment where culture bridges what trauma has severed, the legacy continues.\n\nBrodie Germaine walks these streets differently now - not as someone who has escaped his past but as someone who has transformed it into purpose. The community that raised him, that witnessed his struggles, now witnesses his resurrection. And in that witnessing, in that collective recognition of growth and possibility, lies the true power of NAIDOC - not just to celebrate culture but to embody its continuing evolution, its endless capacity for renewal, its promise that no one is beyond the reach of community love.",

    "content": "## Executive Summary\n\nGovernment investment in youth crime prevention is a welcome and timely step. To truly **transform young lives and enhance community safety**, however, programs must meet a *gold standard* of design and delivery. This position paper outlines a vision for gold-standard youth crime prevention and practical guidance on designing \"kickstarter\" initiatives that change life trajectories for at-risk youth. Key points include:\n\n- **Embrace Evidence-Based Interventions:** Funding alone won't reduce youth crime unless programs use proven, evidence-informed strategies targeting the root causes of offending. Gold-standard initiatives incorporate what works – from family support to cognitive-behavioral training – rather than untested ideas.\n- **Design for Lasting Impact:** \"Kickstarter\" programs should serve as true turning points in a young person's life. This means providing **intensive, personalized support** (mentoring, education, job pathways) that engages youth long-term, not one-off short courses. Effective models have halved re-offending rates by addressing underlying needs.\n- **Strengthen Accountability:** To ensure success, clear outcomes and standards must be set from the start. We recommend rigorous selection criteria for funding, **key performance indicators**, independent evaluations, and transparent progress reporting. This holds program providers accountable and enables continuous improvement.\n\nIn summary, the government's new funding commitment (e.g. Queensland's $100 million for *\"gold standard early intervention\"*) provides an unprecedented opportunity. By adhering to evidence-based principles and high standards, these initiatives can divert young people from crime, delivering safer communities and brighter futures. The following paper details the current gaps and offers recommendations to realise this vision.\n\n## Current Approach: Progress and Gaps\n\n**Positive Steps:** Governments increasingly recognise that *\"one of the best ways to reduce crime is to intervene early\"*. Recent commitments – such as Queensland's new **$50 million \"Kickstarter\" grants program** for community-led youth interventions – demonstrate commendable intent. This fresh focus on prevention and support (education, life skills, and mentoring) is a constructive shift away from sole reliance on punitive measures. It acknowledges that locking up youth is neither a sustainable nor effective solution.\n\n**Lingering Gaps:** Despite good intentions, past approaches to youth crime have fallen short of gold-standard practice. Many programs were launched without a strong evidence base or clear theory of change, leading to uneven results. Oversight bodies have noted a *lack of robust data collection, independent evaluation and outcome monitoring* in youth justice initiatives. Without evidence-based design and rigorous evaluation, even well-funded programs risk failing to reduce reoffending.\n\nMoreover, there has historically been an **imbalance between investment in incarceration vs. prevention**. Taxpayers spend enormous sums detaining young offenders (over **$760,000 per youth annually** in Queensland), yet this *\"failing system\"* does little to rehabilitate and often leads to further crime. In contrast, prevention programs have been comparatively under-resourced and fragmented. Small, short-term projects may lack the scale or continuity to truly change a young person's trajectory. This reactive tilt not only strains budgets but also misses the opportunity to address problems *before* crimes occur.\n\n**Risk of Status Quo:** If new funding simply bolsters a patchwork of unproven initiatives or is driven by political urgency rather than evidence, the outcome will likely mirror past disappointments. Young people may cycle through programs that provide temporary activity but no lasting impact on behaviour or wellbeing. The community will see little safety benefit if underlying drivers (such as family dysfunction, trauma, mental health issues, or disengagement from school) remain unaddressed. In short, **without adherence to high standards, increased spending alone will not deliver the promised reduction in youth crime**. It is crucial to turn positive intent into effective action by defining and implementing true gold-standard practices.\n\n## Defining Gold-Standard Youth Crime Prevention\n\nWhat does \"gold standard\" youth crime prevention look like in practice? It goes far beyond traditional lectures or ad-hoc activities. A gold-standard approach is **comprehensive, evidence-driven, and youth-centred**. Key principles include:\n\n- **Evidence-Based Strategies:** Gold-standard programs are built on approaches proven to reduce youth offending or address its risk factors. This could mean adopting validated models (for example, *family therapy interventions that have cut re-offending by 25–50%*) or designing new initiatives informed by research. Programs should target known drivers of youth crime – such as substance abuse, poor school attachment, lack of job skills, family conflict, and trauma – using methods shown to work (e.g. cognitive-behavioural techniques to improve decision-making and emotional regulation).\n- **Holistic and Multi-Faceted Services:** No single issue leads a young person to crime, and no single-service intervention will pull them out. Gold-standard prevention addresses the **full spectrum of needs**. This means combining **family engagement, education support, mentoring, mental health services, and positive recreational outlets** into an integrated plan. Successful initiatives often provide each youth with a *trusted mentor or caseworker*, training in life and social skills, family counselling, and help reconnecting with school or employment. By stabilizing a young person's environment and relationships, we remove the conditions that foster criminal behaviour.\n- **Early and Targeted Intervention:** The most effective prevention begins **early and targets those at greatest risk**. Resources should be directed to identify vulnerable children and teens *before* they offend or in the very initial encounters with the justice system. Gold-standard programs use data-driven risk assessment to focus on youths with multiple risk factors (such as prior offences, truancy, or family instability) and deliver support at critical turning points (for instance, during the transition from primary to secondary school, or immediately after a minor first offence). This targeting ensures intensive help is provided where it can have the biggest impact, rather than diluting effort on youths unlikely to reoffend.\n- **Intensive, Sustained Engagement:** To truly change life trajectories, interventions must be of sufficient intensity and duration. Gold-standard programs do not consist of one-off workshops or a few weeks of engagement – they **stay with the young person for the long haul**. International best practice shows that interventions yielding real results are *intensive (daily or weekly contact), individualised to each youth's circumstances, and sustained over months or years* as needed. This might include daily after-school activities, 24/7 on-call support in a crisis, or long-term mentoring relationships. Consistency and trust built over time make youth more receptive to guidance, and allow programs to weather setbacks and show gradual progress.\n- **Youth-Centred and Culturally Informed:** Gold-standard prevention meets youth **where they are**. Programs should be engaging and relevant to young people's lives, using approaches that empower youth rather than lecture them. This could involve hands-on learning (e.g. music, sports, or tech projects that build skills and self-esteem) and giving youth a voice in setting goals. Interventions must also be **culturally appropriate** – for example, working with Indigenous elders and community leaders when supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, to ensure respect for cultural identity and to leverage community strengths. A one-size-fits-all approach will not be as effective as one that recognises and responds to the diverse backgrounds of at-risk youth.\n\nBy adhering to these principles, a program truly earns the \"gold standard\" label. It means a young person in the program receives the kind of comprehensive, persistent support that research shows can **divert them from crime and set them on a positive path**. Such approaches have been shown to significantly cut re-offending and even yield *better public safety outcomes than incarceration*, and at far lower cost. In short, gold-standard prevention turns the curve on youth crime by treating its causes – it is proactive, not reactive.\n\n## Designing Transformative \"Kickstarter\" Programs\n\nWith a clear vision of gold-standard practices, how should government design and fund a new **\"Kickstarter\" program** so that it **actually transforms lives**? The term suggests a catalyst or a launch pad – in this context, programs that give at-risk youth a genuine fresh start. Designing such initiatives involves several critical elements:\n\n- **Clear Objectives and Theory of Change:** A transformative program begins with clear, **outcome-focused goals**. For example: reducing reoffending among participants by a certain percentage, improving school attendance, or increasing job placements. The program should have a well-defined *theory of change* that explains how its activities lead to those outcomes (e.g. \"providing a mentor + job training will improve employment prospects and thereby reduce criminal involvement\"). This logical framework, grounded in evidence, guides the program design and helps everyone understand what \"success\" looks like.\n- **Co-Design with Community and Youth:** Government should leverage the knowledge of **community organisations, families, and the youth themselves** in program design. Local non-profits and youth workers often know what approaches resonate with young people in their area. Engaging them in co-design ensures the program is culturally sensitive and addresses real needs. For instance, Queensland's new grants rightly encourage *\"community-led initiatives\"* for youth support. Going further, involving some young people (including former offenders or youth with lived experience) in planning can bring invaluable insight into what might motivate a teenager to choose a better path. This collaborative design builds local buy-in and makes programs more approachable for participants.\n- **Wraparound Support and Coaching:** A \"kickstarter\" program that changes lives must provide **wraparound support** – covering the many facets of a young person's life. This typically includes assigning each youth a dedicated mentor or caseworker who acts as a consistent, positive adult in their life. It also involves working on educational engagement (tutoring or alternative schooling opportunities), job readiness (vocational training, apprenticeships), life skills (communication, financial literacy), and personal development (counselling for trauma, mental health services). Notably, effective programs often *combine mentoring with cognitive-behavioural skill building and family involvement*. For example, a mentor might help a youth practice anger management techniques learned in therapy, or mediate a family meeting to improve home dynamics. This 360-degree approach ensures that as the youth's outlook changes, their environment and skills also improve to support a crime-free life.\n- **Innovation with Fidelity:** Government should encourage innovative solutions – especially for complex issues like youth crime – but innovation must be balanced with **fidelity to what works**. This means funded programs can try new methods or culturally tailored approaches, yet they should incorporate core components that research indicates are effective. For instance, a novel indigenous youth project might blend cultural healing practices with proven mentoring and educational support. Proposals for funding should be required to articulate how their design draws on evidence or established best practices. Where completely new approaches are piloted, they should include strong evaluation plans (discussed below) to quickly identify whether they are delivering the intended impact.\n- **Adequate Duration and Intensity:** A common pitfall in youth initiatives is **insufficient duration or intensity** – expecting major life changes from minimal contact. Truly transformative programs avoid this by ensuring each participant receives substantial attention and time. Funding agreements should reflect the need for multi-month or multi-year engagement, rather than short-term intakes. For example, if the aim is to get a 16-year-old chronic truant back into education and employment, a program might work with them steadily over 12+ months: first stabilising their personal circumstances, then coaching them through a training course, and finally helping them secure and maintain a job. During this period, **intensive support** (possibly daily check-ins or small group sessions multiple times a week) helps maintain momentum. Global evidence supports this – interventions that are *\"intensive, tailored to individual needs, and trauma-informed\"* have far greater success. Governments should thus design funding to enable depth over breadth: it is better to thoroughly transform 100 high-risk youths' lives than to briefly touch 1,000 youths with no lasting change.\n- **Skilled Delivery Teams:** Even the best-designed program will falter without the right people delivering it. Government and grant-makers should ensure that funded initiatives have (or develop) the **workforce capacity** to execute the program with quality. This means investing in training youth workers, educators, and counsellors in the chosen methodologies (for example, training mentors in cognitive-behavioural coaching techniques). Programs should ideally employ staff with relevant qualifications or lived experience and a genuine commitment to helping youth. High staff-to-participant ratios are often needed for intensive work. Additionally, ongoing supervision and support for staff (to prevent burnout and maintain fidelity to the program model) is crucial. When scaling up programs, consider phased growth so quality is not compromised by rapid expansion.\n\nWhen these design elements come together, the \"kickstarter\" program can truly alter a young person's life trajectory. For instance, imagine a youth who was on the brink of entering the justice system: through a comprehensive program, he gets back into school, receives therapy for trauma, finds a supportive peer group in program activities, and gains work experience. Such a youth not only avoids crime but builds a positive identity and future – the ultimate goal of transformative intervention. **The payoff for society is substantial**: research confirms that well-implemented community interventions can yield greater reductions in reoffending than incarceration *and* do so at a fraction of the cost. In designing kickstarter programs, governments have the chance to replace cycles of crime and custody with cycles of opportunity and growth.\n\n## Ensuring Accountability and Success\n\nAchieving high standards in youth crime prevention is not just about initial design – it requires **strong accountability and continuous improvement mechanisms**. Governments must put in place structures to ensure that programs deliver on their promises and public funds are used effectively. Key recommendations include:\n\n- **Set Clear Metrics and Targets:** At the outset, define what success looks like in measurable terms. For example, targets might include *reduction in recidivism rates among participants, increased school attendance, improved employment rates, or fewer arrests*. Each funded program should contribute to these broader outcomes as appropriate. By establishing **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** early, both funders and service providers know how progress will be judged. These metrics should be realistic and aligned with the program's theory of change (e.g. don't expect a dramatic crime drop in 3 months for a heavily disadvantaged cohort – allow time for change).\n- **Robust Monitoring and Data Collection:** Programs must collect and report data regularly to track their performance against the targets. This includes enrollment numbers, participant demographics, services delivered, and short-term outcomes (like skills gained or program completion rates), leading up to long-term outcomes (like offence rates 12 months post-program). **Integrated data systems** or requirements for data sharing (with appropriate privacy safeguards) can help monitor if youth are reoffending or improving in school. The Queensland Audit Office found that poor data capture in the past made it *\"difficult to conclude whether [strategies were] effective\"*. We must not repeat that mistake. Real-time monitoring allows for course corrections – if a tactic isn't engaging youth, programs can adjust quickly rather than waiting for a year-end review.\n- **Independent Evaluation:** Every pilot or newly funded model should include resources for **independent evaluation** by qualified researchers or evaluators. Independent evaluators can design impact assessments (e.g. comparing outcomes of participants to similar youth not in the program) to determine if the program is actually achieving its goals. This can range from qualitative feedback from participants to rigorous quantitative studies (ideally, over time, some programs could even be tested with control groups or other high-quality evaluation methods to establish causality). Importantly, evaluation findings – whether positive or negative – must be transparent. An independent evaluation and transparent reporting of outcomes were explicitly recommended to strengthen youth crime strategies. Learning what doesn't work is just as important as learning what does. Government should be prepared to pivot or cease funding for approaches that evidence shows are ineffective, and conversely, to expand those that demonstrate success.\n- **Governance and Oversight:** Establish a governance mechanism for the overall initiative, such as a steering committee or advisory board comprising government officials, experts, community representatives, and even youth voices. This body can oversee the portfolio of programs, ensure alignment with the strategy's goals, and troubleshoot systemic issues. Regular progress reports should be provided to senior officials and ministers, not just on spending but on outcomes achieved. High-level oversight signals that results matter just as much as effort. It also adds a layer of accountability for keeping the initiative on track toward its crime prevention objectives.\n- **Capacity Building and Support:** Holding programs accountable goes hand-in-hand with **supporting them to succeed**. Government departments should not adopt a \"fund-and-forget\" approach, but rather an active partnership with service providers. This can include offering technical assistance on data collection, facilitating training workshops on evidence-based practices, and fostering a community of practice among grant recipients to share lessons and peer support. If a program is struggling to meet targets, early support or intervention (rather than immediate defunding) can help it improve. Building capacity in the sector is a long-term investment – it will raise the standard of youth interventions generally, beyond just the life of the funding cycle.\n- **Sustainable Funding Commitments:** Finally, accountability and success are bolstered when programs have stable funding over a sufficient period. Short funding cycles or uncertainty can undermine performance – staff get anxious about job security, and youth sense when a program might be fleeting. While it is wise to pilot new initiatives, those that show promise or positive early results should be assured continuity (with ongoing monitoring). The government might consider a model where initial grants are for a pilot period (say 1–2 years), followed by an opportunity to secure extended funding (3–5 years) for programs that meet agreed benchmarks. This balance encourages performance and innovation, while also giving successful programs the runway to achieve lasting impact. It also signals to community partners that government is in it for the long haul, building trust and commitment on all sides.\n\nBy implementing these accountability measures, the government can **ensure the \"gold standard\" is more than a slogan** – it becomes the lived reality of every funded program. Taxpayers and communities deserve to know that this significant investment is yielding results. Regular public reporting on outcomes (for example, an annual youth crime prevention report card) can maintain transparency and political support. Crucially, rigorous accountability does not mean being risk-averse – it means we *learn and adapt*. If one approach isn't delivering, we refine or replace it with a better one, continually driving toward the ultimate goal: fewer young lives lost to crime and fewer victims in our communities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, a **true gold-standard youth crime prevention strategy** is within reach – but it will require commitment to high-quality implementation, not just high dollar amounts. The government's recent initiatives and funding promises show the right intent and have created momentum for change. This paper has argued that to convert that intent into tangible results, policymakers must insist on evidence-based, well-designed programs and a culture of accountability for outcomes.\n\nBy investing wisely in *what works* – comprehensive early intervention that supports youths' needs, builds their skills, and heals underlying issues – we can expect to see real dividends: **reduced offending, improved lives, and safer communities**. On the other hand, falling short of gold-standard practice risks wasting resources and failing the very youth we aim to help. There is perhaps no greater return on investment than turning an at-risk teenager away from a path of crime and toward a productive life. Indeed, effective community programs have demonstrated they can cut reoffending more effectively and humanely than the punitive status quo, all while saving public costs in the long run.\n\nThis is a pivotal opportunity for the government to set a new course. We recommend establishing clear principles (as outlined above) to guide every grant and project: **evidence, holistic design, proper targeting, strong monitoring, and continuous improvement**. With these in place, the term \"gold standard\" will not be merely aspirational – it will be reflected in everyday practice, from a youth worker's mentorship session to an executive briefing on crime stats.\n\nThe challenges of youth crime are complex, but the solutions are within our grasp if pursued diligently. By partnering with communities and experts, holding ourselves accountable to outcomes, and never losing sight of the human stories behind the statistics, we can create programs that truly **transform lives**. The government can lead by example, ensuring that today's investments deliver a safer, brighter tomorrow for our young people and our society. It is both the compassionate and the **smart** approach – one that will justify the public's trust and build a lasting legacy of positive change.",

    "content": "## The Ancient Light Still Illuminating Our Shadows\n\nLast week, I stood at the entrance of what scholars believe could have been the inspiration for Plato's famous allegory—a cave nestled in the ancient hills outside Athens. As sunlight filtered through craggy stone, casting dancing patterns at my feet, I felt the weight of 2,400 years of human wisdom pressing upon me.\n\nIn Plato's allegory, prisoners have been chained since birth inside a cave, facing only the wall before them. Behind them burns a great fire, and between the fire and prisoners is a raised walkway along which people carry objects, projecting shadows onto the wall. The prisoners, having never seen anything else, believe these shadows to be reality itself. Should one prisoner be freed and dragged into the sunlight, they would first be blinded, disoriented, unable to comprehend the true forms they now encounter. Upon returning to the cave to free others, they would appear blind and foolish to those still enchained, their warnings unheeded, their wisdom rejected.\n\nStanding there, I couldn't help but see our current youth justice system reflected in this ancient wisdom—a system where we have collectively chained ourselves to shadows of our own making, mistaking them for reality.\n\n## The Modern Cave: Australia's Youth Justice Shadows\n\nIn Australia today, we sit before a wall where shadows dance—shadows of \"youth crime waves,\" of \"tough on crime\" policies, of dehumanising narratives that reduce young people to their worst moments. These projections tell us simple stories: that punishment equals safety, that incarceration equals transformation, that First Nations children are 24 times more likely to be detained because of inherent deficiencies rather than systemic failures.\n\nThe statistics cast their own haunting shadows: 91% of young people released from detention in Queensland return within 12 months. We spend $1,500 per child per day on detention that demonstrably fails to rehabilitate. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth comprise 7% of young Australians but over 50% of those in detention.\n\nBehind these shadows stand powerful projectors—political expedience, media sensationalism, colonial legacies, and the comfort of simple narratives that protect us from confronting more complex truths. We have grown so accustomed to these shadows that we mistake them for reality itself, believing there is no other way to see.\n\n## JusticeHub: The Journey Toward Sunlight\n\n\"The unexamined system is not worth perpetuating,\" Plato might say today. JusticeHub emerges as a pathway out of the cave—an invitation to turn away from the shadow play and toward the illuminating light of community wisdom, lived experience, and collective reimagination.\n\nLike the freed prisoner in Plato's allegory, JusticeHub seeks to guide us toward seeing the true forms beyond the shadows:\n\n- **Beyond the shadow of \"youth criminals\"** lies the true form of young people with boundless potential, often navigating trauma, poverty, and systemic barriers with remarkable resilience.\n- **Beyond the shadow of \"failed communities\"** lies the true form of Indigenous wisdom, grassroots innovation, and community solutions that have always existed but remained \"in the shadows,\" unseen by mainstream systems.\n- **Beyond the shadow of \"punishment as solution\"** lies the true form of rehabilitation models that actually work—like those pioneered by organizations such as the Diagrama Foundation, where relationships and education, not walls and weapons, create transformation.\n\nAs one community leader from Mount Isa articulated: \"We've got to be very mindful of who we're talking to and what we're talking about, and we need to be coming down onto their level of understanding. We've got to make sure that when we are talking to our own people that we don't lift our standard up in our vocabulary either.\"\n\nThis wisdom reflects a profound understanding that true knowledge isn't about imposing one reality over another, but about meeting people where they are and walking together toward greater understanding.\n\n## The Mechanics of Seeing Differently\n\nJusticeHub's approach echoes the philosophical journey out of Plato's cave through several key mechanisms:\n\n**1. Collaborative Knowledge-Sharing**\nJust as Plato envisioned knowledge as a collective journey toward truth, JusticeHub creates a decentralided platform where communities can share what works. When justice reinvestment modeld reduces youth arrests by 35%, other communities can \"fork\" this knowledge, adapting it to their own cultural contexts.\n\n**2. Elevating Unheard Voices**\nThe prisoners in the cave could only see the shadows cast by others. JusticeHub inverts this dynamic by amplifying the voices of those traditionally silenced—young people with lived experience, First Nations communities, and grassroots organizations developing solutions outside the spotlight of mainstream attention.\n\n**3. Reimagining Metrics of Success**\nIn the cave, reality is constrained by limited perception. Similarly, our current systems measure success through narrow metrics like detention rates rather than healing, restoration, and community strength. JusticeHub introduces impact dashboards that track not just recidivism but positive indicators—community connection, cultural identity, and genuine pathways to belonging.\n\n**4. Creating Spaces for Collective Reimagination**\nPlato understood that liberation requires not just new information but new ways of seeing. JusticeHub's \"Forkathons\" create spaces where communities can collectively reimagine approaches to youth justice, based not on abstract theory but on programs demonstrably working in similar contexts.\n\n## The Pain and Promise of Transformation\n\nThe journey out of the cave is neither comfortable nor simple. Plato reminds us that the freed prisoner first experiences pain when facing the sun's true light—disorientation, resistance, even ridicule from those still enchained.\n\nWe witness this discomfort today in resistance to evidence-based approaches that challenge punitive paradigms. When successful models like Diagrama (with recidivism rates of just 13.6% compared to Australia's 80-90%) are presented, they often face skepticism. \"Too soft,\" critics claim. \"Wouldn't work here,\" others insist, clinging to the familiar shadows on the wall.\n\nThis resistance is exactly what Plato predicted. Transformation requires not just new information but a fundamental shift in how we see—a form of death and rebirth that many naturally resist. The prisoner who returns to the cave appears blind and foolish to those still in chains, just as advocates for restorative approaches often face dismissal from those invested in punitive systems.\n\n## The Collective Journey Toward True Forms\n\nThe power of Plato's allegory lies not just in its critique of false perception but in its vision of collective liberation. The freed prisoner returns to the cave not to condemn those still in chains but to invite them into a larger reality.\n\nSimilarly, JusticeHub emerges not as a criticism of current systems but as an invitation to greater possibility—a platform where grassroots organiations in Palm Island can share their community patrol successes that reduced unlawful entry offences from 30 to 4 in just three months, where the Burdekin Area Youth Watch can document how supporting young people exposed to domestic violence keeps families together.\n\nThese are not shadows but tangible realities—programs working today in communities across Australia, often with minimal resources and recognition. JusticeHub seeks to bring these innovations from the margins to the center, not through imposition but through inspiration, not through dictation but through demonstration.\n\n## The Courage to See\n\nAs we stand together at this threshold—between the familiar comfort of shadows and the challenging brilliance of true light—we face the same choice as Plato's prisoner: retreat into comfortable darkness or step forward into transformative illumination.\n\nThis journey requires revolutionary patience. It demands that we become architects of new paradigms, weavers of new narratives, carriers of torches into places long kept dark. It asks us to hold both the pain of seeing clearly and the possibility of creating differently.\n\nThe young people currently caught in our failed systems cannot wait for gradual awakenings. The communities developing solutions on shoestring budgets cannot sustain their work in isolation. The knowledge being generated in one region must not remain trapped there while other regions struggle with identical challenges.\n\nJusticeHub represents not just a platform but a philosophy—a commitment to seeing beyond shadows, to honoring knowledge wherever it emerges, to building bridges between islands of innovation. It embodies the conviction that our collective wisdom, when properly harvested and shared, contains the seeds of transformation our systems so desperately need.\n\n## The Light Beyond\n\n\"Those who are able to see beyond the shadows and lies of their culture will never be understood, let alone believed, by the masses,\" Plato wrote. Yet he also believed in the possibility of collective enlightenment—that through dialogue, through relationship, through persistent invitation, we might guide one another toward greater truth.\n\nStanding in that ancient cave last week, watching light and shadow dance across stone worn smooth by centuries of human contemplation, I felt both the weight of our current failures and the lightness of possibility that awaits us.\n\nThe shadows on our wall are not our destiny. They are simply projections of limited perception, of systems designed for another time, of narratives that serve some at the expense of many. Beyond these shadows lies a landscape of community wisdom, of proven solutions, of approaches that heal rather than harm.\n\nTogether, we step into the light. Together, we tell new stories. Together, we transform shadows into substance.\n\n*[Image: A photograph of the cave outside Athens, sunlight filtering through ancient stone—a reminder that wisdom sometimes waits in unexpected places, illuminating pathways toward collective liberation.]*\n\n*\"We are not just participants, but architects of a new paradigm. Each conversation, each connection becomes a thread in a larger tapestry of collective reimagination. Our mountains are internal and external - requiring courage, vulnerability, and an unwavering commitment to seeing beyond current limitations. Remember: Every breakthrough begins with the audacity to imagine differently. Together, we climb.\"*",

That the young person is dangerous, untrustworthy, unworthy of beauty or comfort. We choose to communicate something different.\"",
    "content": "***Part 4 of \"Reimagining Youth Justice: A Journey Beyond Walls\"***\n\nThe light filters through curtains – actual curtains, not metal grates – casting gentle patterns across wooden floors. A teddy bear rests atop a neatly made bed with blue linens. A desk holds photographs of family and friends, carefully arranged. A pillow embroidered with \"A Mi Hija\" (\"To My Daughter\") speaks of connection beyond these walls.\n\nThis room in Diagrama's La Zarza facility would be unremarkable in most contexts – a typical teenager's space, perhaps a bit tidier than most. But within the context of youth detention, it represents something revolutionary: the understanding that physical environments are not merely backdrops but active participants in the work of transformation.\n\n## The Language of Space\n\nAs we move through Diagrama's facilities, I'm struck not by sophisticated architecture or expensive materials, but by the fundamental message embodied in these spaces: these are places for living, not merely for containing. The buildings speak before the staff do, communicating expectations and possibilities that shape how young people understand themselves and their potential.\n\n\"The environment is not separate from our therapeutic approach – it is integral to it,\" explains Teresa, a facility director. \"What does a concrete cell with steel furniture communicate? That the young person is dangerous, untrustworthy, unworthy of beauty or comfort. We choose to communicate something different.\"\n\nThis philosophy manifests in countless details: bedrooms with real furniture that can be personalized with photographs and mementos; common areas with comfortable seating arranged to facilitate conversation; classrooms filled with natural light; kitchens where young people learn to prepare meals together; gardens tended by residents who watch their efforts literally bear fruit.\n\nThese spaces aren't luxurious, but they are intentional – designed to foster both physical and psychological safety, to create environments where growth becomes not just possible but probable.\n\n## The Dignity of Personhood\n\nOne of the most striking features of Diagrama's approach is how young people are invited to personalize their spaces and take responsibility for them. Rather than being assigned to institutional cells, they inhabit rooms that reflect their identities and relationships.\n\nAs two young women proudly show me their rooms, pointing out photographs of friends and family, explaining art projects they've completed, I witness a profound connection between space and selfhood. They speak not of \"the room\" but of \"my room\" – a subtle linguistic shift that reflects a deeper reality of belonging and ownership.\n\n\"When young people first arrive, some are surprised they can have personal items,\" Teresa notes. \"They have often come from environments – both at home and in previous institutional settings – where their personhood was diminished. Having a space that is recognizably their own is part of restoring a sense of identity and dignity.\"\n\nThis approach extends beyond bedrooms to all areas of the facility. Young people participate in maintaining and improving common spaces – planting gardens, creating murals, arranging furniture. These activities do more than beautify the environment; they cultivate responsibility, pride, and investment in the community.\n\n## The Invisible Architecture of Security\n\nPerhaps what most distinguishes Diagrama's facilities is not what is present but what is absent: the overt trappings of security and control that dominate most detention environments. While security measures exist, they are designed to be unobtrusive rather than dominating the physical and psychological landscape.\n\n\"Security comes primarily from relationships and engagement, not from physical barriers,\" explains Jesús Teruel. \"When young people feel connected and valued, when they have meaningful activities and relationships to maintain, they are less likely to attempt escape or violence.\"\n\nThis philosophy creates a virtuous cycle: less oppressive security measures create spaces where positive relationships can flourish, which in turn reduces the need for oppressive security measures. The result is environments that feel more like boarding schools than prisons – places of learning and growth rather than punishment and containment.\n\nThis is not to say boundaries don't exist – they most certainly do. During my visit, I witness a conversation between a center manager and a young person who had absconded the previous day. But even this interaction reflects the environmental philosophy: the manager approaches with a warm embrace rather than punitive authority, speaking closely: \"Why did you do that? Don't do that again.\" Their conversation holds both accountability and affection, boundaries wrapped in belonging.\n\n## The Aesthetics of Hope\n\nWalking through one of Diagrama's facilities, I notice something unexpected: beauty. Not extravagance or luxury, but intentional aesthetic choices – colourful walls, natural materials, carefully tended plants, student artwork prominently displayed.\n\nWhen I comment on this, Teresa smiles. \"Beauty is not a luxury – it is essential to our work. How can we ask young people to aspire toward something better if we surround them with ugliness? How can we help them imagine beautiful futures if their present environment communicates only deprivation and despair?\"\n\nThis perspective challenges the often unconscious belief that those who have committed offenses somehow deserve unattractive or uncomfortable surroundings – that aesthetic deprivation is part of punishment. Instead, Diagrama recognizes that environments of beauty and dignity are prerequisites for the work of transformation, not rewards for its completion.\n\n## The Emotional Environment\n\nBeyond the physical architecture lies what might be called the emotional architecture of Diagrama's spaces – the intangible but palpable atmosphere created by how people relate to each other within these walls.\n\nAs we move through common areas, I notice young people and staff engaged in ordinary activities together – preparing food, playing board games, tending plants, discussing weekend plans. There is laughter, casual conversation, the natural rhythm of shared life. The emotional environment feels neither artificially cheerful nor oppressively controlled – simply human.\n\n\"One of our goals – and some may criticise this – is for the young person to be happy here,\" Jesús had told me earlier. \"Because being happy, feeling good, allows them to change and absorb new concepts and ways of expressing their emotions.\"\n\nThis philosophy creates what might be called an \"emotional safety zone\" – an environment where young people can experience not just physical security but psychological safety. Within this zone, they can practice vulnerability, process difficult emotions, attempt new behaviors, and even fail without catastrophic consequences.\n\n## The Journey Ahead\n\nAs I prepare to leave La Zarza, I reflect on the mountain before us in Australia. Reimagining the environments of youth detention requires more than new buildings or softer furnishings – it demands a fundamental philosophical shift in how we understand the relationship between space and transformation.\n\nThis shift begins with a radical premise: that environments of dignity and beauty are not luxuries or rewards but essential elements of rehabilitation. It requires us to examine our often unconscious belief that punitive environments somehow contribute to behavioral change, when evidence consistently shows the opposite.\n\nThe journey ahead will challenge deeply held beliefs about security, risk, and the very purpose of detention. It will demand that we reimagine not just our facilities but our fundamental approach to creating spaces for transformation.\n\nBut I've witnessed the destination, and it calls us forward. I've seen young people flourishing in environments designed for growth rather than mere containment. I've observed the profound impact of spaces that communicate worth rather than worthlessness, potential rather than danger.\n\nThe mountain before us is steep, but the view from the summit – a youth justice system where environments nurture rather than merely confine – is worth every step of the climb.\n\nTogether, we journey toward this vision – not as an idealistic dream but as a practical pathway toward more effective rehabilitation and safer communities.\n\nTogether, we climb.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n\n- Physical environments communicate powerful messages about identity and worth\n- Diagrama's facilities feel more like boarding schools than prisons\n- Young people are given agency to personalize spaces and take responsibility for them\n- Even security measures are designed to be unobtrusive rather than dominant\n- Beauty and comfort are seen as essential elements of rehabilitation, not luxuries\n- The environment creates both physical and emotional safety for transformation",

    "excerpt": "In my third reflection from Spain's Diagrama centres, I witness a profound reimagining of what it means to work with troubled youth.",
    "content": "# From Control to Care: Reimagining Staff Roles in Youth Justice\n\n*Part 3 of \"Reimagining Youth Justice: A Journey Beyond Walls\"*\n\nIn the evening hours at Diagrama's El Raso centre, I watch a remarkable scene unfold. A young person—frustrated after a difficult phone call home—begins to pace, his body language signalling the rising tide of emotions within. In many facilities, this would trigger an immediate security response: staff closing in, voices hardening with command, the subtle shift toward containment and control.\n\nInstead, I witness something altogether different. A staff member—not a specialised crisis worker but an ordinary social educator—approaches with calm presence. He doesn't raise his voice or issue commands. He simply asks, \"Would you like to talk about it, or would you prefer some space?\"\n\nThis moment, ordinary in its outward appearance yet revolutionary in its approach, crystallises what might be the most transformative aspect of Diagrama's model: the fundamental reimagining of staff roles from controllers to caregivers, from guards to guides.\n\n## The Paradigm Shift\n\nIn Australia, staff in youth detention facilities are often conceptualised primarily as custodial officers—their core function defined by security, containment, and control. This framing creates a fundamental antagonism: young people become problems to manage rather than humans to develop.\n\n\"We understand that security matters,\" explains Jesús Teruel during my visit. \"But security emerges naturally when young people feel seen, valued, and engaged. It is a byproduct of good relationships and meaningful activities, not something imposed through force or fear.\"\n\nThis subtle but profound shift reframes everything. Staff appear relaxed yet attentive, engaged but not controlling. They move among young people with the natural authority that emerges from relationship rather than the artificial authority conferred by uniform or role.\n\n## The Educator at Heart\n\nAt Diagrama, the primary staff role is that of \"social educator\"—a concept that deserves deeper exploration in the Australian context. These educators live daily life alongside young people, from morning routines through meals, activities, conflicts, and celebrations.\n\n\"Our job is to accompany them through the ordinary moments of life,\" explains Carmen, who has worked at Diagrama for fifteen years. \"In these ordinary moments—making breakfast together, solving a disagreement, celebrating a birthday—we create extraordinary opportunities for growth.\"\n\nThis educative role transcends formal programs or therapy sessions. Every interaction becomes a potential teaching moment—a chance to model conflict resolution, emotional regulation, or healthy communication. The result is a living curriculum of human development, delivered not through workbooks but through authentic presence.\n\n## The Unified Team\n\nAnother striking element of Diagrama's approach is the absence of rigid role hierarchies. While specialized professionals (psychologists, social workers) provide targeted interventions, they work in seamless coordination with social educators. There is no sense of \"my domain\" versus \"your domain\"—simply a unified team working toward shared goals.\n\n\"We meet daily to discuss each young person,\" Carmen explains. \"Everyone contributes their observations and insights—from the teacher who noticed a young person's growing confidence in class to the kitchen staff who observed them helping others during meal preparation.\"\n\nThis integration ensures that insights don't remain isolated within professional silos but inform a holistic approach to each young person's development. The psychologist's insights about trauma responses inform how social educators approach conflict; the educator's observations about daily behavior inform the psychologist's therapeutic interventions.\n\n## The Internal Journey\n\nPerhaps most radical is the recognition that staff must undertake their own journey of transformation to effectively support young people's growth. Rather than donning a professional mask that separates them from those they serve, staff at Diagrama cultivate self-awareness, emotional literacy, and authentic presence.\n\n\"Working here has transformed me as much as it has transformed the young people,\" Miguel reflects. \"I've had to examine my prejudices, manage my triggers, develop greater patience and empathy. You cannot help someone else transform if you are not willing to transform yourself.\"\n\nThis willingness to be changed by the work creates a profound modeling opportunity. Young people witness adults who acknowledge mistakes, manage emotions effectively, and maintain boundaries without dehumanization. For many, this represents the first experience of adults who embody the very qualities they are asked to develop.\n\n## The Parenting Paradigm\n\nJesús offers a compelling framework that encapsulates Diagrama's approach: \"Think of good parenting. A good parent maintains clear boundaries while providing unconditional worth. They balance accountability with support, consequences with care. This is our model—not security guard or prison officer, but wise and loving parent.\"\n\nThis parenting paradigm creates space for both structure and nurture, for both accountability and compassion. It acknowledges the developmental reality that adolescents need both freedom to make mistakes and guidance to learn from them.\n\nFor young people who have often experienced either harsh control or negligent permissiveness, this balanced approach represents a new possibility—a middle path where they are both held accountable and held in high regard.\n\n## The Journey Ahead\n\nAs I prepare to leave El Raso, I reflect on the mountain before us in Australia. Reimagining staff roles requires more than new job descriptions or training programs—it demands a fundamental philosophical shift in how we conceptualize youth justice.\n\nThis shift begins with a radical premise: that staff in youth justice settings are not primarily guards containing problems but guides nurturing potential. It requires recruiting differently, training differently, and measuring success differently.\n\nThe journey ahead will challenge deeply held beliefs about authority, security, and the very purpose of youth detention. It will demand that we reimagine not just our facilities but ourselves—our relationship to young people who offend, our beliefs about transformation, our willingness to be changed by the work of changing others.\n\nBut I've witnessed the destination, and it calls us forward. I've seen staff working with the most challenging young people not from a position of fear or control but from a place of genuine care and commitment to growth.\n\nThe mountain before us is steep, but the view from the summit—a youth justice system where staff guide rather than guard, nurture rather than neutralize, transform rather than simply contain—is worth every step of the climb.\n\nTogether, we journey toward this vision—not just for the young people in our care but for the transformation of our own professional identity and purpose.\n\nTogether, we climb.",

    "content": "*Part 2 of \"Reimagining Youth Justice: A Journey Beyond Walls\"*\n\nIn the soft light of early morning, I watch as Manuel, a social educator at Diagrama's La Zarza centre, sits down beside a young person who seems withdrawn, shoulders hunched against the world. Their conversation begins tentatively – quiet words exchanged over a shared breakfast – but gradually unfolds into something remarkable: genuine connection.\n\nThis scene, repeated countless times across Diagrama's centres, illuminates what might be the most revolutionary aspect of their approach: the primacy of relationship in the work of transformation.\n\n## The Bridge Before the Building\n\nIn Australia, we often approach troubled youth with an arsenal of programs, assessments, and interventions. We dive immediately into \"fixing\" behaviour before establishing the relational foundation that makes change possible. It's like attempting to build a house on sand, then wondering why it keeps collapsing.\n\n\"The programs and activities are important,\" explains Jesús Teruel, \"but they are vehicles, not the destination. The real work happens in the space between people – in how we greet them each morning, how we sit with their anger without absorbing it, how we maintain hope when they cannot.\"\n\nThis philosophy manifests in extraordinary staff consistency. Unlike systems where burnout and turnover create a revolving door of relationships, Diagrama staff often remain for years, even decades. The message this sends to young people is profound: You are worth staying for.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6541df32dc229bb7babac598/67e1231b403390f91eac1f0d_Spain-Diagrama-LR-136.jpg)\n\n## The Art of Being Affected\n\nOne of the most striking differences I observed was the willingness of staff to be genuinely affected by the young people in their care. In Australia, we often valorise professional distance – the ability to remain emotionally untouched. This creates a hidden curriculum that teaches young people they are problems to be managed rather than humans to be known.\n\nAt Diagrama, I witnessed a different paradigm: staff who weren't afraid to care deeply, to celebrate victories and mourn setbacks, to be transformed themselves by the work of transformation.\n\n\"Of course we are affected,\" Ana tells me with a gentle smile. \"How could we not be? These young people become part of our lives. We think about them after work; we worry about their futures. This is not a weakness in our approach – it is essential to it.\"\n\nThis willingness to be affected creates a profound modelling opportunity. Many young people in detention have never witnessed healthy attachment, emotional regulation, or conflict resolution. Staff who engage authentically – who show up human and whole – provide a living curriculum in these essential life skills.\n\n## The Counterintuitive Path to Safety\n\nThere's a common misconception that emotional connection compromises safety and security. The opposite proves true at Diagrama. Centres where staff maintain genuine relationships with young people have fewer incidents of violence and disruption.\n\n\"Young people behave better when they feel they have something to lose,\" explains Jesús. \"When they value relationships with staff, when they feel a sense of belonging in the community we create, they make different choices.\"\n\nThis reflects a profound truth about human behaviour: connection is a more powerful motivator than control. Young people who feel genuinely valued will work to maintain that connection, even when it requires difficult behavioral changes.\n\n## The Bridge Back to Community\n\nPerhaps most importantly, authentic relationships within detention create a blueprint for relationships beyond it. Young people learn that connection is possible, that they are worthy of care and investment, that vulnerability can lead to growth rather than exploitation.\n\nMany youth in detention have experienced relationships primarily as sources of pain, manipulation, or disappointment. Experiencing consistent, boundaried care rewrites their internal narrative about what relationships can be.\n\n\"We are teaching them how to be in relationship,\" explains Teresa, another staff member. \"How to trust appropriately, how to manage conflict, how to repair after mistakes. These are the skills that will determine whether they succeed after release.\"\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6541df32dc229bb7babac598/67b13229027f0ee0d82c623c_Spain-Diagrama-LR-85.jpg)\n\n## The Courage to Connect\n\nAs I prepare to leave La Zarza, I reflect on what might be the greatest barrier to implementing this approach in Australia: not budget constraints or political will, but the courage to connect.\n\nOur systems often implicitly discourage the very connections that catalyze change. We fear accusations of impropriety, crossing boundaries, or lacking objectivity. These fears, while understandable, have created sterile environments where transformation struggles to take root.\n\nWhat I witnessed at Diagrama was not the absence of boundaries but their thoughtful implementation – clear lines that created safe spaces for authentic connection rather than preventing it.\n\nThe mountain before us requires not just structural change but personal courage – the willingness to be affected, to care deeply, to invest authentically in young lives that society has often deemed unworthy of such investment.\n\n## The Journey Continues\n\nAs we reimagine youth justice in Australia, we must reconsider not just what we do but how we do it – not just our programs and protocols but the quality of human connection that animates them.\n\nThe revolution waiting in our youth justice system begins with a radical premise: that transformation happens not through our sophisticated interventions but through the simple, profound act of one human being truly seeing another.\n\nThe path ahead is not easy. It requires vulnerability, consistency, and the willingness to be changed by those we seek to change. But I've witnessed the destination, and it calls us forward.\n\nThe mountain before us is steep, but the view from the summit – a justice system where authentic connection creates pathways for genuine transformation – is worth every step of the climb.\n\nTogether, we journey toward this vision – not just as professionals implementing programs, but as fellow humans invested in creating a world where every young person knows they matter.\n\nTogether, we climb.",

    "content": "# Beyond Walls: What Spanish Youth Detention Centers Taught Me About Seeing Humanity First\n\n*Part 1 of \"Reimagining Youth Justice: A Journey Beyond Walls\"*\n\nIn the morning light filtering through the windows of Diagrama's La Zarza centre, I witnessed what can only be described as a quiet revolution. Young people—many convicted of serious offenses—engaged in conversation with staff who carried no weapons, wore no uniforms, displayed no badges of authority. Just humans connecting with humans.\n\nThis scene represents the profound paradox at the heart of effective youth justice: the most secure facilities are those where connection, not control, forms the foundation.\n\n## The Courage to See Beyond Labels\n\n\"We aren't jailers,\" explained Jesús Teruel, Territorial Director for Murcia, as we walked corridors that felt more like a school than a detention centre. \"We're not just enforcing a sentence to pass the months until they leave. We're here to work with them, to transmit values, to show them there's a different way.\"\n\nThis perspective requires something our system often lacks: the courage to see beyond the offence to the young person behind it. To recognize that a 15-year-old who has committed a serious crime isn't defined by their worst moment but contains multitudes—trauma, yes, but also dreams, talents, and the capacity for transformation.\n\nIn Australia, we've responded to youth crime with increasingly punitive measures—building higher walls, imposing longer sentences, creating harsher conditions. Yet our recidivism rates show the failure of this approach. We keep doing more of what doesn't work, hoping for different results.\n\n## The Art of Human Connection\n\nWhat struck me most wasn't sophisticated programs or cutting-edge facilities, but something far more fundamental: the quality of human connection. Staff members knew each young person's story, their triggers, their aspirations. They navigated conflicts not with power and control but with genuine curiosity and respect.\n\nOne staff member shared, \"Before we can expect them to change, they need to feel that someone genuinely cares about their future. Not because it's our job, but because we see their worth.\"\n\nThis isn't sentimentality—it's strategy. Young people who feel seen and valued develop something essential to behavioral change: a sense that they have something to lose by returning to old patterns.\n\n## The Mountain Before Us\n\nTransforming Australia's approach to youth justice feels like a mountain almost too steep to climb. We face entrenched attitudes, political complexity, and the inertia of systems resistant to change.\n\nBut standing in Diagrama's centres, watching young people engaged in education, vocational training, and meaningful conversation, I was reminded that Spain once stood where we stand now. Their journey toward transformation began with individuals brave enough to imagine differently.\n\nEach interaction I witnessed at Diagrama reflected a fundamental truth: walls alone cannot create safety. True security emerges when young people develop internal resources—the ability to regulate emotions, resolve conflicts, and envision a future worth working toward.\n\n## The Journey Home\n\nAs I prepare to return to Australia, I carry with me not just program details or statistics, but living proof of what's possible when we prioritise humanity in our justice system.\n\nThe journey ahead is long and complex. It will require challenging deeply held beliefs about punishment and accountability. It will demand that we reimagine not just our facilities but our fundamental relationship with young people who offend.\n\nBut I've seen the destination, and it's worth the climb.\n\nThe revolution waiting in our youth justice system isn't about tearing down walls—it's about seeing through them to the humanity that exists on both sides. When we have the courage to truly see each other, transformation becomes not just possible, but inevitable.\n\nThe mountain before us is steep, but the view from the summit—a just society where every young person has the opportunity to heal, grow, and contribute—calls us forward, one step at a time.\n\nTogether, we climb.\n\n## Key Insights:\n\n- Spanish youth detention centers achieve lower recidivism through relationship-based approaches\n- Staff view themselves as mentors and educators, not guards or jailers\n- Young people respond to authentic human connection more than control measures\n- The environment feels more like a school than a prison\n- Transformation begins with seeing the person beyond their offense\n- Australia's punitive approach continues to fail despite evidence",

    "excerpt": "Stories from the frontlines of Indigenous youth empowerment in Queensland's Lower Gulf",
    "content": "In the red dust country of Northwest Queensland, where the earth meets endless sky and history runs deeper than the ancient waterways, a revolution of the spirit is taking place. Not with banners and slogans, but with campfires and yarning circles, with sweat and muscle, with stories older than memory yet newly awakened in the hearts of young people who had forgotten how to belong.\n\nThis is CAMPFIRE – not just a program, but a passage. A journey of remembering, of becoming, of transformation that begins with a single question: what happens when we approach wounded young people not as problems to be solved, but as fires waiting to be kindled?\n\n## The Birth of CAMPFIRE: From Personal Wound to Community Healing\n\nThe story of CAMPFIRE cannot be told without first understanding the journey of its founder, Brodie Germaine. A Pitta Pitta, Wakka Wakka man born to the red earth of Kalkadoon country in Mount Isa, Brodie's early years were textured with both possibility and pain.\n\n\"I existed between worlds,\" Brodie reflects, his voice carrying the weight and wisdom of this liminality. \"Seen as too white by some in my community but deeply connected to my Aboriginal heritage. The landscape of my childhood was complex: housing commission homes, family members cycling through the justice system, and the constant presence of violence and substance abuse.\"\n\nYet within this complexity, a gift emerged – athletic prowess that offered the first glimpse of a different future. Football became Brodie's language of possibility, carrying him to Queensland representation, even captaining the state side – \"a profound moment for a boy from the bush,\" as he recalls with quiet pride. This athletic promise opened doors beyond Mount Isa, leading to Ignatius Park College in Townsville on a rugby league scholarship.\n\nBut at 18, standing at the threshold of opportunity, Brodie encountered drugs for the first time. \"What followed was a descent that cost me my football contract and disconnected me from my values and identity. I spiraled through a period of addiction, regret, and lost purpose.\"\n\nThe redemption in this story came through an unexpected invitation – a men's camp led by renowned Aboriginal Elder Ernie Dingo. Initially reluctant – having just survived a suicide attempt – Brodie attended only at his partner's insistence. What happened next rewrote the trajectory of his life.\n\n\"In a yarning circle on Country, surrounded by 60 men, I found my voice. For the first time, I spoke about my struggles, my shame, my journey. That circle became the birthplace of my mission.\"\n\nUnder Ernie's mentorship, Brodie began facilitating Camping on Country programs throughout the Gulf, supporting men through healing and cultural reconnection. Parallel to this cultural work, his passion for fitness grew. What began as personal training sessions in a shed during COVID evolved into a full gym – Brodie Germaine Fitness – more than just a physical space, but a sanctuary where community members could find strength, connection, and purpose away from lateral violence and substance abuse.\n\nToday, these twin vocations have merged into CAMPFIRE – an integration of cultural immersion, fitness, and mentorship designed to interrupt the cycles of youth crime and disconnection plaguing Mount Isa and surrounding communities.\n\n## Beyond Punishment: Reimagining Youth Justice Through Cultural Connection\n\nThe context that birthed CAMPFIRE is stark. Mount Isa's watchhouses overflow with young Indigenous people. The dominant narrative reduces these young lives to statistics, to problems, to bodies that must be contained rather than souls that long to soar.\n\n\"When people don't understand connection to country, they see it as just going out bush, as having a good time,\" Brodie explains. \"Some don't realise the cultural benefits and aspects around what connection to country is.\"\n\nThis misunderstanding has profound consequences. Government allocates $1.2 billion toward enforcement and incarceration – approximately $1 million per year to keep a single young person in detention – while preventative cultural programs struggle for the fraction of those resources required to create lasting change.\n\nCAMPFIRE stands as a counter-narrative, a living testimony that transformation happens not through punishment but through belonging; not through isolation but through integration; not through breaking spirits but through awakening ancestral strength that has always existed within.\n\n\"As an Aboriginal person, I still don't understand how you measure 'healing' on paper,\" Brodie reflects. \"But maybe the way to measure a young person's healing stages would be... if I take them out bush, and then when they return to community, they start to make changes with their personal lives, with their family, the way they communicate, the way they listen.\"\n\nThis is the medicine that no policy document can fully capture – the profound shift that happens when a young person disconnected from their cultural inheritance suddenly finds themselves sitting with Elders under stars that have witnessed the passage of countless generations, learning to make didgeridoos that help with anxiety through breath control, fishing with techniques passed down for millennia, experiencing presence in ways impossible amidst the chaos of town life.\n\n## The Three Pillars: Cultural Immersion, Physical Empowerment, Relational Mentorship\n\nThe architecture of CAMPFIRE rests on three interconnected foundations, each essential to the whole:\n\n### Cultural Immersion: Remembering Who We Are\n\nThe centerpiece of CAMPFIRE is the 'Camping on Country' expeditions, where Indigenous youth spend seven-day periods with Elders and traditional owners in remote areas without phone reception or modern distractions. These immersive experiences include traditional hunting, fishing, tool-making, and storytelling, reconnecting young people with their cultural heritage and identity.\n\n\"Something about Country, that spiritual feeling that really, really helps the mind, body, and soul when you reconnect to land,\" Brodie shares, echoing the sentiment of countless participants who have experienced this reconnection.\n\nEach camp is conducted with proper cultural protocols, always involving Elders from the specific Country being visited. This adherence to traditional ways of knowledge-sharing and permission-seeking models for young people the importance of respect, reciprocity, and relationship with land and community.\n\n\"As Aboriginal people, we do consultation naturally,\" Brodie explains. \"When you meet someone, it's 'Hey, where are you from? Who are your mob? Who's your totem?' So you start to pick up on those little things.\"\n\nThis natural flow of connection stands in stark contrast to bureaucratic understandings of \"community consultation\" that reduce profound cultural protocols to tick-box exercises. CAMPFIRE embodies authentic consultation through relationship, through story, through shared experience on Country.\n\n### Physical Fitness: Embodying Strength and Discipline\n\nThrough his community gym in Mount Isa, Brodie provides structured fitness programs tailored to young people's needs and abilities. These sessions build physical strength while developing discipline, goal-setting abilities, and healthy stress management techniques.\n\n\"Exercise doesn't always have to be the gym,\" Brodie emphasizes. \"It can be going out taking your dog for a walk, walking up a hill, or doing anything. The gym is a good tool to get people in the doors, and then from there we can offer a lot more like our on-country programs.\"\n\nThe gym serves as both training ground and community hub – a safe space where young people can belong regardless of circumstances. Physical movement becomes a pathway to mental clarity, emotional release, and embodied confidence. Young people discover that the same discipline that builds muscle can build life.\n\n### Mentorship: Walking Alongside on the Journey\n\nCAMPFIRE matches each young person with a dedicated mentor who provides consistent support, guidance, and advocacy. Mentors help participants navigate challenges, celebrate successes, and build practical life skills. The relationships formed often become lifelines for young people with few positive adult connections.\n\n\"The feeling I get taking people out on country is overwhelming,\" Brodie shares. \"Being Aboriginal, I'm very passionate about my culture and being able to show people and community my culture, it makes me feel proud. I'm really proud to do this.\"\n\nThis pride becomes contagious, flowing from mentor to mentee, creating a current of cultural strength that carries young people toward new possibilities. The intergenerational exchange of knowledge helps heal historical fractures while ensuring cultural wisdom flows forward, reinvigorating traditional teachings in contemporary contexts.\n\n## Beyond Programs: Creating an Ecosystem of Care\n\nCAMPFIRE is not an isolated intervention but part of a broader vision to transform how communities support Indigenous youth. Additional initiatives include:\n\n- **School-Based Support**: Partnering with local schools to provide in-class mentoring and fitness activities, helping keep young people engaged in education.\n- **Cultural Exchange**: Developing exchanges between Mount Isa youth and urban communities, broadening horizons and building cross-cultural understanding.\n- **Wellness Center Vision**: Working toward establishing a comprehensive wellness centre that combines fitness facilities, cultural programming, and support services under one roof.\n\nAll these initiatives employ a trauma-informed approach that recognizes the impacts of intergenerational trauma while emphasizing strength, resilience, and cultural pride as pathways to healing.\n\n\"My five-year plan for Brodie Germaine Fitness would be to turn it into a wellbeing centre,\" Brodie explains. \"The dream would be to have a 24-hour gym with classes. I'd also love to have a place for recovery, a place for young people for program delivery, education sessions... a space where people of all backgrounds in the community can go for health and wellbeing, cultural programs, and even a space where they know that if you're feeling low and you need a safe space, you can come.\"\n\nThis vision represents more than infrastructure – it embodies a paradigm shift in how we understand and respond to community needs. Rather than fragmented services that address isolated symptoms, CAMPFIRE seeks to create an integrated ecosystem of care that nourishes whole persons in the context of their culture, community, and country.\n\n## Walking Together: An Invitation to Collective Transformation\n\nThe story of CAMPFIRE offers profound implications for all who care about the wellbeing of young people, the preservation of cultural knowledge, and the creation of just communities. It invites us to reimagine how we support Indigenous youth – moving beyond punishment toward healing, beyond programs toward relationship, beyond intervention toward cultural empowerment.\n\nFor government and funding bodies, the invitation is clear: Invest in prevention rather than incarceration. The economic argument alone is compelling – preventative cultural programs require a fraction of incarceration costs. But beyond economics lies a moral imperative to nurture potential rather than punish pain.\n\nFor service providers, CAMPFIRE demonstrates the power of culturally-led, trauma-informed approaches that center the voice and agency of young people. The invitation is to build coordinated networks of support that wrap around each young person with consistent care rather than fragmented services.\n\nFor community members, there are countless ways to participate: Volunteer time, skills, or resources. Visit the gym, participate in community events, or contribute to camping programs. Most importantly, challenge the narratives that criminalise youth rather than addressing the root causes of their behaviour.\n\nFor fellow Indigenous leaders, CAMPFIRE extends an invitation to collaborate across regions, sharing models and learning from each other's successes and challenges. \"Our strength lies in our unified approach to cultural reclamation and youth empowerment,\" Brodie emphasizes.\n\nFor young people themselves, the message is perhaps most powerful: Your voice matters in shaping these programs. You are not merely participants but co-creators of a movement that honours your experience and builds on your strengths.\n\n## The Fire That Transforms: From Individual to Collective Healing\n\nIn Aboriginal cultures across Australia, fire has always served as both destroyer and creator – clearing what no longer serves, making way for new growth, transforming landscapes to ensure the continued flourishing of all life. CAMPFIRE embodies this dual nature of transformation.\n\nFor Brodie personally, the journey continues to be one of healing through service. \"Every young person I reach reminds me of my own journey from lost to found, from isolation to belonging,\" he reflects. \"Through CAMPFIRE, I create the spaces I needed when I was young – spaces of cultural pride, physical strength, and unconditional belief in potential.\"\n\nFor the community of Mount Isa and surrounding regions, CAMPFIRE represents a beacon of possibility – demonstrating that even in communities facing significant challenges, cultural wisdom holds the keys to regeneration and renewal.\n\nFor the broader Australian society, CAMPFIRE offers a profound challenge to dominant paradigms of youth justice, cultural preservation, and community well-being. It asks us to consider what might be possible if we centred Indigenous knowledge systems, if we invested in cultural connection rather than carceral responses, if we truly believed in the inherent dignity and potential of every young person.\n\nThe campfire has always been a gathering place – where stories are shared, where wisdom is passed down, where communities remember who they are and envision who they might become. Today, in the red dust country of Northwest Queensland, these ancient fires are being rekindled. And in their light, young people are discovering – often for the first time – the beauty of their inheritance, the strength of their ancestors, and the boundless possibilities of their futures.\n\nThis is not merely a program. It is a passage. A remembering. A revolution of the spirit that begins with a simple invitation: gather around the fire, listen to the stories that have always been yours, and discover that the flame of transformation was never something external – it has always burned within you, waiting only to be awakened.\n\n*This CAMPFIRE illuminates a path forward – not just for the young people of Mount Isa, but for all who seek to create communities where healing, belonging, and cultural pride flourish. As Brodie reminds us: \"We walk this path together – not as saviors and saved, but as a community committed to creating the conditions where every young person can thrive in the fullness of their cultural identity and personal potential.\"*",

If large organizations dominate the grants, a significant portion could be absorbed by administrative costs and bureaucracy, rather than directly reaching young people and community-based solutions.\n\n## Introduction\n\nQueensland’s youth justice system is under intense scrutiny amid high reoffending rates and public concern about youth crime. In recent data, **91% of young people released from Queensland detention returned within 12 months** ([LNP - Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP)](https://online.lnp.org.au/news/lnp-announces-staying-on-track-program#:~:text=Queensland%20has%20the%20highest%20rate,to%20detain%2C%20not%20rehabilitate%20offenders)) – the highest recidivism in Australia. In response, the state’s *Making Queensland Safer* plan (a 2024 election platform) introduced two major grant-funded initiatives: **“Staying on Track”** and **“Regional Reset.”** These programs, budgeted at **$175 million and $50 million over four years respectively** ([Youth Justice Power Point Presentation](https://www.publications.qld.gov.au/dataset/1a2ee949-274e-4068-914f-58478c54df41/resource/ffc58aeb-78f7-408c-bd7a-97f01143237a/download/a-conversation-on-the-initiatives.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Range%20of%20election%20commitments,%2480%20million)), aim to rehabilitate at-risk youth through intensive support and early intervention. This report examines how these grants are structured and how they could be better deployed to empower grassroots community solutions in youth justice. It also analyses the risks of large organisations monopolising funds, compares youth justice funding models in Spain and Scotland, reviews cost-effectiveness (administration vs. frontline investment), and outlines policy recommendations to maximise community impact.\n\n## 1. Funding Allocation and Community Impact\n\n### Current Structure and Distribution\n\nThe **Staying on Track** program is designed as a post-detention rehabilitation scheme for every youth leaving detention ([DYJVS-0015_Staying_on_Track-Request_for_Quote.pdf](file://file-jugexfnwoomq2duapnnadz%23:~:text=1,including%20deliverables/)). Under this model, a community service provider is paired with each young person *while they are still in custody*, then continues to mentor and support them for **12 months after release** ([LNP - Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP)](https://online.lnp.org.au/news/lnp-announces-staying-on-track-program#:~:text=Under%20the%20LNP%E2%80%99s%20plan%2C%20young,over%20the%20year%20after%20release)). Every young offender gets a tailored “Successful Release Plan” with goals around education, training, work and positive activities (e.g. schooling or TAFE, driving lessons, mentoring, sports) ([LNP - Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP)](https://online.lnp.org.au/news/lnp-announces-staying-on-track-program#:~:text=Under%20the%20LNP%E2%80%99s%20plan%2C%20young,over%20the%20year%20after%20release)). The funding – roughly **$43–45 million per year** (from the $175m/4yrs) – is being split into regional service hubs. A recent procurement brief shows **12 regional hubs** across Queensland, each with a specified annual allocation (for example, about **$6.98 million per year for the Townsville/Mackay hub** serving ~130 youths) ([DYJVS-0015_Staying_on_Track-Request_for_Quote.pdf](file://file-jugexfnwoomq2duapnnadz%23:~:text=townsville/)). The largest hubs (Townsville, Cairns, Ipswich/West Moreton) have ~$6–7 million per year, while smaller areas (e.g. Cherbourg) have under $1 million ([DYJVS-0015_Staying_on_Track-Request_for_Quote.pdf](file://file-jugexfnwoomq2duapnnadz%23:~:text=cherbourg%20yjsc%20$807,175/)). Notably, for several hubs the government **“prefers Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander suppliers”** ([DYJVS-0015_Staying_on_Track-Request_for_Quote.pdf](file://file-jugexfnwoomq2duapnnadz%23:~:text=cherbourg/)) – an attempt to engage Indigenous-led organizations for communities with high First Nations youth representation.\n\nThe **Regional Reset** program is a complementary early intervention initiative. It establishes **nine short-term residential “reset” camps** (1–3 week live-in programs) across the state ([LNP - Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP)](https://online.lnp.org.au/news/lnp-announces-regional-reset-early-intervention-programs#:~:text=The%20facilities%20will%20provide%20a,in%20a%20web%20of%20crime)). Each camp will serve a broad region (Far North, North, Central, Wide Bay, Western Qld, etc.), aligning with the areas announced in the policy ([LNP - Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP)](https://online.lnp.org.au/news/lnp-announces-regional-reset-early-intervention-programs#:~:text=The%20LNP%20will%20deliver%20a,each%20of%20the%20following%20regions)). The **$50 million fund (over 4 years)** covers all nine sites ([DYJSV-0004_RFQ_Regional_Reset.pdf](file://file-4wfpgdkvfvhigbkfxvqmnu%23:~:text=match%20at%20l160%20the%20regional,gold%20standard%20early%20intervention%20and/)). The program targets children **8–17 years old** who exhibit serious risk factors (violence, truancy, substance abuse) **but may not yet be entrenched in crime** ([DYJSV-0004_RFQ_Regional_Reset.pdf](file://file-4wfpgdkvfvhigbkfxvqmnu%23:~:text=the%20program%20is%20an%20early,may%20be%20disengaged%20from%20school/)). Youth can be referred by schools, police, child safety or parents. Each Regional Reset center provides an intensive supervised environment – described as a “circuit-breaker” for “out-of-control youths” ([LNP - Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP)](https://online.lnp.org.au/news/lnp-announces-regional-reset-early-intervention-programs#:~:text=The%20Regional%20Reset%20Program%20forms,careening%20toward%20lives%20of%20crime)) – focused on **life skills, self-discipline, counseling, and cultural or adventure activities** ([DYJSV-0004_RFQ_Regional_Reset.pdf](file://file-4wfpgdkvfvhigbkfxvqmnu%23:~:text=the%20program%20is%20intended%20to,activities,%20skills,%20adventure%20and%20sport/)). Importantly, the model isn’t just a short camp: it includes **pre-camp engagement with the family, the live-in reset, and follow-up aftercare** with mentoring and referrals in the community ([DYJSV-0004_RFQ_Regional_Reset.pdf](file://file-4wfpgdkvfvhigbkfxvqmnu%23:~:text=the%20program%20is%20intended%20to,activities,%20skills,%20adventure%20and%20sport/)). A cross-agency/community referral panel in each location will triage which youth attend the program ([DYJSV-0004_RFQ_Regional_Reset.pdf](file://xn--file-4wfpgdkvfvhigbkfxvqmnu%23:~:text=%20the%20overarching%20program%20is,phase%20model-1059c/)). By design, *Regional Reset* “works hand-in-hand” with other initiatives like the Gold Standard Early Intervention and Youth Justice “academy” schools ([DYJSV-0004_RFQ_Regional_Reset.pdf](file://file-4wfpgdkvfvhigbkfxvqmnu%23:~:text=the%20regional%20reset%20program%20,also%202024%20state%20election%20commitments/)), forming an integrated early intervention network.\n\n### Reallocating Funds to Grassroots for Local Impact\n\nWhile these programs are substantial investments, their impact will depend on *who* delivers the services. There is a strong case for channeling funds to **grassroots and community-based organisations** rather than relying solely on large central providers. Grassroots groups – local youth services, Indigenous community organisations, volunteer-driven clubs, etc. – are often deeply embedded in the community and can engage high-risk youth with greater credibility, cultural relevance, and trust. For example, Queensland’s tender for Staying on Track explicitly allows **partnerships or consortiums** so providers can cover large catchments ([DYJVS-0015_Staying_on_Track-Request_for_Quote.pdf](file://file-jugexfnwoomq2duapnnadz%23:~:text=to%20cover%20the%20large%20geographic,entire%20geographic%20catchment%20is%20covered/)). This creates an opportunity for big NGOs to partner with smaller local groups, or for regional coalitions of community orgs to bid. Priority regions like Cairns, Mount Isa, Cherbourg have **encouraged Indigenous-led bids** ([DYJVS-0015_Staying_on_Track-Request_for_Quote.pdf](file://file-jugexfnwoomq2duapnnadz%23:~:text=aboriginal%20and%20torres%20strait/)), recognizing that local Aboriginal-run services may connect better with Indigenous youth (who form a majority of those in the justice system). By **reallocating a significant portion of grant funding to on-the-ground community partners**, the programs can leverage local knowledge and relationships. For instance, instead of one large agency running a Regional Reset camp with fly-in staff, the funding could support a collaboration of local elders, youth workers and counsellors from that region. This grassroots approach ensures interventions are **tailored to local context** (language, culture, community dynamics) and that communities have ownership of solutions.\n\nResearch strongly supports the effectiveness of **community-led solutions in youth justice**. Around the world, **keeping youth in their communities under supportive supervision leads to better outcomes than incarceration** ([Effective Alternatives to Youth Incarceration – The Sentencing Project](https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/effective-alternatives-to-youth-incarceration/#:~:text=By%20now%20the%20verdict%20is,system%20biases%2C%20these%20harms%20of)). In Queensland, the Youth Justice Commissioner observed that **community-based youth justice is not only more successful in changing behavior, but also far cheaper than detention** – costing about **10 times less** per child (). Diversionary and rehabilitative programs driven by community actors can significantly cut reoffending. A meta-analysis of 29 trials found that **formal justice responses made reoffending more likely than diversion programs**, and police-led cautions/diversions achieved lower reoffending (44% vs 50%) than court processing (). European countries favour cognitive-behavioural programs delivered in community settings over punitive measures, precisely because **punitive approaches often *increase* recidivism** (). Empowering community organisations to address underlying issues – family dysfunction, trauma, disengagement – can break the cycle of crime more effectively. These local groups often take a **holistic approach** (mentoring, cultural reconnection, education support, family mediation) that addresses the causes of offending, not just the symptoms. In sum, **investing grant funds at the grassroots level can maximise local impact**: it not only strengthens community capacity but also increases the chances that young people will respond positively, seeing familiar faces and culturally appropriate support instead of distant authority figures. Every dollar spent on a community-led program is likely to yield higher social returns in terms of reduced crime and improved youth outcomes.\n\n## 2. Risks of Large Organisations Dominating Funding\n\n### Concentration of Funding in Large NGOs\n\nA potential pitfall in the rollout of Staying on Track and Regional Reset is if the funding is captured mainly by **large NGOs or government-aligned organisations**, rather than distributed among smaller community providers. Major non-government organisations (NGOs) – often charities or corporate service providers – have the capacity to bid for multi-million-dollar contracts across multiple regions. However, **when big organizations dominate funding, certain risks emerge**. First, it can **crowd out grassroots initiatives**: smaller groups may lack the resources to compete in procurement processes, so the same big players get funded repeatedly. Queensland’s Auditor-General noted that in recent years the department sometimes renewed or procured services **without adequately testing the market or justifying provider choices** ([Reducing serious youth crime | Queensland Audit Office](https://www.qao.qld.gov.au/reports-resources/reports-parliament/reducing-serious-youth-crime#:~:text=The%20department%2C%20who%20is%20responsible,Contract%20management)). This raises the risk that funding decisions become insular, favouring established vendors rather than the most effective local solutions. If Staying on Track’s 12 regional contracts, for example, were all won by a handful of large NGOs, the program could end up **operating top-down** with a one-size-fits-all model, instead of the intended community-tailored approach.\n\n### Administration vs Direct Community Impact\n\nLarge organisations often have significant **administrative overheads** that can siphon funding away from frontline services. These NGOs maintain centralised offices, management staff, marketing and governance structures that smaller grassroots groups do not. While some larger charities are efficient (e.g. Save the Children Australia reports about **81% of spending on programs vs ~7% on admin** ([What Percentage of Donation Goes to Charity](https://www.savethechildren.org.au/about-us/save-the-childrens-charity-work/what-percentage-of-donation-goes-to-charity#:~:text=What%20Percentage%20of%20Donation%20Goes,Children%20Australia%27s%20total%20expenditure))), investigations show others have very high overhead. In Australia, certain well-known charities have been found to spend **over half of their income on administration and fundraising** ([Giving Guide | The Overhead Myth](https://gg.org.au/the-overhead-myth/#:~:text=taking%20the%20amount%20a%20charity,income%20on%20fundraising%20and%20administration)). In a youth justice context, a big provider might use grant funds to cover layers of project managers, analysts, and corporate costs – meaning perhaps only a fraction reaches the youth workers and mentors on the ground. By contrast, a small local youth service might dedicate nearly every dollar to direct support (with maybe a volunteer board and minimal admin). **Excessive administrative spending dilutes community impact**: for example, if a $1 million grant is delivered by a bureaucratic agency with 30% overhead, that’s $300k lost to paperwork and salaries that never interact with youth. There is also the risk of *bureaucratic inertia* – large institutions may be less agile in responding to individual needs. Community members sometimes complain that big agencies come with preset programs and heavy reporting requirements, rather than adapting to what the community knows works. In youth justice, building rapport quickly with vulnerable teens is critical; a small grassroots team might achieve that through informal, relationship-based practice, whereas a big NGO might be more constrained by protocols.\n\n### Bureaucratic Inefficiencies and Leakage\n\nGovernment-aligned or internal government delivery can likewise suffer from bureaucratic inefficiency. Funds can get tied up in lengthy planning, coordination meetings, and inter-departmental processes before services reach young people. In Queensland’s youth justice system, multiple agencies and levels of approval are often involved ([PDF] Changes to the youth justice system must be designed and ...](https://www.qfcc.qld.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-07/Inquiry%20into%20Youth%20Justice%20Reform%20in%20Queensland%20-%20PCMR%20Luke%20Twyford_Redacted.pdf#:~:text=,the%20police%20and%20the%20courts)). This complexity can slow down initiative rollout. The new grants themselves require oversight – for instance, the department will monitor providers via an online reporting system and formal evaluations ([DYJSV-0004_RFQ_Regional_Reset.pdf](file://file-4wfpgdkvfvhigbkfxvqmnu%23:~:text=3/)). While accountability is important, overly onerous compliance can **divert provider effort to paperwork over practice**. The challenge is ensuring that the substantial investments “at the top” quickly translate to action at the grassroots. Queensland Audit Office findings underline this: the youth justice department **was not effectively evaluating outcomes data provided by NGOs** ([Reducing serious youth crime | Queensland Audit Office](https://www.qao.qld.gov.au/reports-resources/reports-parliament/reducing-serious-youth-crime#:~:text=offenders%20and%20reducing%20their%20reoffending,it%20to%20formally%20evaluate%20these)), meaning money was spent without learning what worked. Additionally, some large contracts were managed with minimal documentation of why that provider was chosen ([Reducing serious youth crime | Queensland Audit Office](https://www.qao.qld.gov.au/reports-resources/reports-parliament/reducing-serious-youth-crime#:~:text=,decisions%20needs%20to%20be%20strengthened)), which could mask under-performance. All these inefficiencies ultimately reduce the tangible benefit felt in communities.\n\n### Ensuring Funds Reach the Ground\n\nTo mitigate these risks, specific strategies must accompany the grants. **Transparency in funding allocation** is key – publishing which organisations receive funds and how much reaches direct services. Caps or guidelines on allowable administrative costs can be imposed in contracts (for example, requiring that at least 80–90% of funds go to service delivery costs). Queensland’s procurement for Staying on Track encourages...",

    "content": "# Beyond Systems: A Day with Jackqwann in the Heart of Australia\n\n![Jackqwann](/images/articles/beyond-systems-a-day-with-jackqwann-in-the-heart-of-australia-1-2e3627eb.jpg)\n\nIn Alice Springs' shimmering heat, I sat beside a young man named Jackqwann whose rap lyrics cut straight to the heart of what it means to stand at the crossroads of identity and belonging:\n\n## \"I'm just a normal kid\"\n\nThose words – the opening line of Jackqwann's rap – reverberate with profound simplicity and devastating truth. Not a stereotype, not a statistic, not a problem to be solved. A normal kid navigating an extraordinary set of circumstances.\n\n*\"I don't wanna grow up in the system\nI don't wanna spend my life in prison\nI don't wanna do time for you snitch\nMy brothers and sisters...\"*\n\nHis lyrics carry the weight of decisions that most Australian teenagers will never face. Each day presents choices with consequences that extend far beyond detention slips or grounding – they can mean entering systems designed to contain rather than nurture.\n\nKristy Bloomfield, co-founder of Oonchiumpa Consultancy and Services, speaks with piercing clarity about young people like Jackqwann: \"The challenges that led into getting into trouble was around peer pressure, and being part of the gang, and showing that he's tough in that aspect.\"\n\nBut she also sees beyond those moments to the deeper human yearning: \"What led him out to where he is now... that experience in Don Dale, away from family, away from country, but also away that he was restricted from visiting anybody and had to be isolated from everybody... that's now led him to take a realization of what he needs to do to stay outta trouble.\"\n\n## Between Two Worlds\n\nOur day unfolded not in revelatory conversations but in small moments of connection – selecting new shoes, finding essentials at the shops, setting up comfortable sleeping arrangements. Each step building not just physical comfort, but relational trust.\n\nThe camera I'd brought remained mostly unused. For Jackqwann, like many Indigenous youth, shame around speaking directly to a stranger was palpable. Cultural protocols and personal history created invisible boundaries around certain conversations. But in the spaces between awkward questions, in the silence of simply being together, pathways opened.\n\nWhat struck me most powerfully was witnessing the relationship between Jackqwann and his Oonchiumpa mentor. The ease, the shared understanding, the absence of judgment – these created a foundation that no government program could replicate.\n\nThis is the essence of Oonchiumpa's \"Two Cultures, One World\" philosophy – creating bridges between worlds that honour cultural identity while building capacity to navigate contemporary realities.\n\nAs Tanya Turner explains: \"Our role is twofold. It's as a cultural broker, so to link them and empower them in their identity as an Aboriginal person, make them feel strong in that. Make them feel proud of their identity... And then the other aspect is to bridge the gap for them between that aspect of who they are and the western world.\"\n\nWhen Jackqwann raps:\n\n*\"Now it's time to stay out trouble\nChill back with my chores and stay humble\nPractice my culture. Pass it on to the young\nLearn from the Elders and gotta stay strong.\"*\n\nHe's articulating exactly this path – integrating cultural knowledge with contemporary reality, not abandoning either world, but learning to walk confidently between them.\n\n## The Australia We Don't See\n\nThe Australia that appears in news cycles presents Alice Springs as a place of crisis – youth crime, substance abuse, neglect. But spending time with Jackqwann revealed the profound limitation of those narratives.\n\nAs Kristy observes: \"Our town and the country lack empathy for our young people. The challenges that our young people are facing – overcrowding, housing, unfortunately family and domestic violence in the town camps and also lack of food in the homes for our kids.\"\n\nBehind every headline about a stolen car is a young person seeking belonging, excitement, status, or escape. Behind every statistic is a complex web of historical trauma, systemic barriers, and individual circumstances. And within each young person is the same desire that pulses through all humanity – to be seen, to belong, to matter.\n\n*\"I wanna break the cycle\nI don't wanna jump in\nUse a little stupid driver walking uptown\nI see a stolen car, told me jump in\nBut I say, nah, nah\"*\n\nThese aren't just lyrics; they're strategic life decisions. Each one represents a moment where Jackqwann chose a different path despite the gravitational pull of peers, circumstances, and limited alternatives.\n\n## Cultural Authority as Liberation\n\nWhat organisations like Oonchiumpa offer isn't merely \"services\" or \"programs\" – it's relationship rooted in cultural authority and genuine care.\n\n\"These kids that we work with, they're really good kids when we are working with them,\" Kristy emphasizes. \"Yes, they can be naughty sometimes, however they are looking for support from our service providers around town.\"\n\nThe approach is both intensely practical and spiritually grounded. Oonchiumpa helps young people access educational opportunities, sports programs, and essential services that others take for granted. But they do so while strengthening cultural identity, family connections, and community belonging.\n\nWhen Jackqwann flew a drone for the first time during our day together, I witnessed the spark of curiosity and capability that lives within him. That moment wasn't about technology – it was about expanding his sense of possibility, about demonstrating that he could master something new, about connecting through shared experience rather than interrogation.\n\n## Beyond Punishment, Toward Healing\n\nAs our day ended and I watched Jackqwann retreat into his home, I couldn't help but reflect on the parallels between his journey and Australia's broader journey of reconciliation. Both require acknowledging painful histories without being defined by them. Both demand walking new paths while honoring ancient wisdom. Both necessitate seeing beyond stereotypes to embrace complex humanity.\n\nWhen Jackqwann raps \"I don't wanna grow up in the system,\" he's not just speaking about juvenile detention. He's articulating a vision for a different kind of future – one where Indigenous youth aren't defined by their interactions with correctional facilities but by their connections to culture, community, and country.\n\n\"Keep different and stop doing the same,\" he concludes – a profound call not just to his peers, but to all of us who claim to care about young people in communities like Alice Springs.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful change happens not through grand interventions, but through consistent presence and cultural belonging. When young people know they are seen not as problems but as bearers of ancestral wisdom and future possibility, transformations become possible that no punitive measure could ever achieve.\n\nThe future of places like Alice Springs doesn't lie in heightened policing or punitive measures. It lives in the lyrics of a young man who, despite everything, still sees himself as \"just a normal kid\" with the power to \"break the cycle.\" It flourishes in the patient mentorship of traditional owners who understand that cultural connection is both anchor and sail.\n\nTogether, they're not just navigating between two worlds – they're creating a new one.\n\n*This reflection comes from time spent with Oonchiumpa Consultancy and Services in Alice Springs. Their culturally-led work with young people is part of a broader movement to reimagine approaches to justice and healing across Australia. Stay tuned for more on this journey.*",

    "content": "# Beyond Cases and Problems: Relationship-Based Justice in Central Australia\n\n![Beyond Cases and Problems](/images/articles/beyond-cases-and-problems-relationship-based-justice-in-central-australia-1-e75838d3.jpg)\n\nReflections on bridging legal systems and cultural knowledge to create meaningful pathways for young people caught between worlds in Mparntwe.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe first time Tanya truly saw the beauty of Mparntwe was when she returned home after years away. Driving in from the airport, the MacDonnell Ranges rose before her, and something shifted in her perception. The landscape she had taken for granted as a child suddenly revealed itself as extraordinary. This moment mirrors what happens in their work with young people – helping them see themselves and their community through fresh eyes, recognizing beauty and possibility where others might see only problems.\n\nTanya's path through law has taken her from the Supreme Court of Victoria to remote communities under gum trees, from child protection cases to family mediations with a 95% success rate. Through these diverse experiences, one truth has become increasingly clear: justice emerges through relationship, not merely through proper application of legal principles.\n\n## Navigating Complex Landscapes\n\nIn Alice Springs, young people navigate complex landscapes – both the literal country around them and the often-contradictory expectations of different worlds. The systems designed to support them frequently fail to recognize the deeper contexts that shape their experiences and behaviors. Media narratives reduce complex realities to simplistic stories of dysfunction, missing the strength, resilience, and possibility that exist alongside very real challenges.\n\nShe remembers sitting with a young girl during a basketball game, watching her light up as she contemplated joining a team. This simple outing – something many families take for granted – represented a new possibility, a glimpse of belonging in a community space she hadn't previously felt welcome to enter. The barriers weren't just practical (though those existed too – no one to help complete the sports voucher form, no transport to games) but relational – not seeing herself reflected in these spaces, not having pathways to participation.\n\n## Historical Context and Cultural Brokerage\n\nThe historical context shapes everything about the current reality in Alice Springs. The policies that removed children, displaced families, and attempted to sever cultural connections haven't just disappeared – their impacts continue to reverberate through generations. When Tanya conducts cultural awareness sessions with health professionals who've lived in Alice for decades, they often weep upon learning histories they never knew, finally understanding contexts that make sense of what they witness daily.\n\nThis historical understanding isn't about assigning blame but about creating foundations for genuine change. They cannot address present challenges without acknowledging their roots. Young people deserve to understand the broader stories that have shaped their families and communities – not to burden them with historical trauma, but to help them locate their own experiences within contexts that make sense of their reality.\n\n## Creating Spaces for Growth\n\nAs a mediator, Tanya learned that resolution comes not from imposing solutions but from creating spaces where all voices can be heard, where different perspectives can find common ground. This approach guides how they work with young people at Oonchiumpa – not telling them who they should be or what they should do, but creating opportunities for them to discover their own pathways, supported by cultural connection and practical skills.\n\nCultural brokerage forms a critical aspect of their approach. Young people often fall through gaps between services not because support doesn't exist, but because navigating complex systems requires resources they don't yet have. Something as simple as helping complete a sports voucher form or connecting them with a youth-friendly doctor can open doors that previously seemed locked. These practical supports build trust that allows deeper engagement with questions of identity and purpose.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe most powerful aspect of their work isn't what they do for young people, but what they help them discover about themselves. When a young person recognizes their own capacity, when they connect with cultural strength that has sustained their people through immense challenges, something fundamental shifts in how they approach life's difficulties.\n\nTanya has witnessed this transformation repeatedly – young people who were defined by systems as \"problems\" revealing themselves as leaders, mentors, and knowledge-holders when given the right opportunities and support. This isn't about dramatic intervention but about consistent presence, authentic relationship, and genuine belief in their fundamental worth and potential.\n\nThe vision driving Oonchiumpa extends beyond individual transformation to community healing. They seek not just to support young people navigating current systems but to transform those systems through Aboriginal leadership and cultural knowledge. They envision a future where young people don't have to choose between cultural identity and contemporary opportunity – where they can move confidently between worlds, drawing strength from ancient wisdom while engaging with modern possibilities.\n\nThis vision requires partnership across different sectors of the community. It means businesses opening doors for young people to gain experience and skills. It means schools creating spaces where cultural knowledge is valued alongside academic learning. It means government agencies supporting Aboriginal-led initiatives rather than imposing external solutions.\n\nMost fundamentally, it means seeing young people not as problems to be fixed but as bearers of possibility – the generation who might heal historical wounds while creating new pathways forward. Oonchiumpa's role is simply to walk alongside them, offering guidance when needed, stepping back when appropriate, always believing in their capacity to navigate between worlds with strength and purpose.\n\nThe path forward isn't simple, but nothing worthwhile ever is. As they continue this journey of supporting young people in Mparntwe, Tanya draws strength from witnessing their resilience, their humor, their profound capacity for growth when given the right opportunities. They are not merely the future of the community – they are its present hope, already contributing in ways that often go unrecognized but that matter deeply to the heart of this place they call home.",

This country has held Kristy's people for countless generations, the stories embedded in every ridge and waterhole. As she watches young people from town arrive at Atnarpa Homestead for cultural camps, she sees both disconnection and possibility in their eyes.\n\nThese young ones carry complex histories. Many have been labeled \"troublemakers\" or \"at-risk\" by systems that fail to see the fullness of who they are. What these systems miss is the profound yearning for belonging that drives so much of their behavior – a hunger to understand their place in a world that has often pushed them to the margins.\n\nKristy's own journey informs how she approaches this work. She carries the stories of her grandmother, an Alyawarra woman who would place her children in the sun to darken their skin before authorities came, desperately trying to protect them from removal. She holds the memory of her grandfather, himself a stolen generation survivor, who formally married her grandmother despite already being traditionally married, just to prevent their children from being taken.\n\nThese stories of resistance and protection aren't simply family history – they're the living context for Oonchiumpa's work with young people today. The legacies of these policies continue to shape families and communities, creating ruptures in the transmission of cultural knowledge and identity that they now work to heal.\n\n## Cultural Authority and Healing\n\nAt Oonchiumpa, their approach emerges from cultural authority as traditional owners. When young people step onto country with them, they enter a relationship governed by responsibilities that precede any government program or intervention strategy. This relationship creates possibilities that conventional services cannot access – the capacity to speak with cultural authority that young people recognize and respect.\n\nKristy remembers a young man who joined them for a healing journey to Atnarpa. Initially reluctant and withdrawn, something shifted for him as they shared bush medicine knowledge and stories around the fire. Watching the family at Atnarpa conducting tours for visiting students, he witnessed Aboriginal knowledge being valued and shared. Later, he asked thoughtful questions about his own family connections and how he might learn more about his cultural responsibilities.\n\nThis young man has since reconnected with his extended family and now participates in cultural tourism on his own country. The transformation wasn't through a structured program or intervention, but through witnessing cultural pride and possibility – seeing pathways between worlds that he could walk with strength and dignity.\n\n## The Importance of Aboriginal-led Solutions\n\nThis experience illustrates why Aboriginal-led, culturally grounded approaches are essential. Young people need more than services – they need connection to identity, purpose, and place. They need to see themselves reflected in positive representations of Aboriginal achievement and cultural continuity. They need pathways that honor who they are while creating practical opportunities for where they might go.\n\nThe challenges facing these young people cannot be addressed in isolation from broader community healing and empowerment. This is why Oonchiumpa's vision extends beyond youth programs to economic self-determination on traditional lands. At Loves Creek Station, they're working to create sustainable enterprises that honor cultural values while building generational wealth and employment pathways.\n\nImagine a future where these young people can find meaningful work on country, contributing to enterprises led by their own people, grounded in cultural knowledge while engaging with contemporary opportunities. This vision motivates Kristy and her team to persist despite funding uncertainties and systemic barriers.\n\n## Navigating Between Worlds\n\nThe journey ahead isn't simple. They navigate between worlds themselves – maintaining cultural protocols while engaging with government requirements, honoring traditional decision-making while functioning within corporate structures. This complexity isn't a weakness but a strength – it mirrors exactly the skills their young people need to develop.\n\nAs the campfire burns low and the young people share stories and laughter, Kristy sees glimpses of the future they're working toward. One where cultural strength provides the foundation for navigating life's challenges. Where young people walk with confidence between worlds because they know who they are and where they belong. Where their community leads its own healing and development, drawing on ancient wisdom to address contemporary challenges.\n\nThis vision isn't just for their young people – it's for all of Alice Springs. When Aboriginal young people thrive, connected to culture and community while developing diverse skills, the whole town benefits. This is the future worth fighting for, one campfire conversation, one on-country journey, one young person at a time.\n\n![Author Benjamin Knight](/images/articles/navigating-two-worlds-cultural-authority-and-youth-empowerment-in-mparntwe-2-e00356dc.jpg)\n\n### About the Author\n\n**Benjamin Knight**\n\nWriter and photographer\n\nCurious.

    "excerpt": "Richard Cassidy shares Indigenous wisdom through storytelling, navigating traditional and Western knowledge systems while empowering future generations to connect with country and culture.",
    "content": "# Richard Cassidy: Bridging Two Worlds Through Story\n\nRichard Cassidy is a First Nations man whose journey embodies the bridging of cultural knowledge with modern practice. Connected deeply to his grandmother's country on Manbarra land at Palm Island, he carries forward a profound cultural obligation passed down from his grandfather.\n\n## Connection to Country\n\n\"This is my grandmother's country. And she's a mum of a woman. We married a Nahuatl man,\" Richard explains, situating himself within his lineage. \"Grandfather would say to me, you know, Richie, you're always gonna look after your grandmother's country.\"\n\nFor Richard, country isn't just land—it’s identity and purpose:\n\n\"Country helps me be, and helps me be me, and helps me understand who I am. And it's out of that, from that base of where I land, that I can work out what my doing is going to be.\"\n\n## Creating \"Our Story\"\n\nRichard believes deeply in the power of shared narratives. His approach centres on respectful listening and the merging of different perspectives:\n\n\"There are people who are wanting to come into this space and would love to be able to engage with me or my people. And I say to folk, well, tell me your story and I'll tell you my story and then we'll try and figure out how my story and your story can become an our story.\"\n\nThis philosophy guides how he builds relationships across cultural divides:\n\n\"It's a very, I think, it's an easier vehicle to be able to engage with conversation as human beings, rather than as first people, second people, or whatever construct you want to use... Story is a good vehicle to be able to work on, because everyone understands that story, that concept of story.\"\n\n## Navigating Two Worlds\n\nRichard speaks often about navigating between traditional knowledge and modern systems:\n\n\"I navigate those two worlds intuitively inside almost all day every day. So I've got this dominant culture side and I've got this cultural side. And one informs each other.\"\n\nHe uses the metaphor of a spear with two edges—the L-O-R-E (traditional law) and the L-A-W (Western legal systems):\n\n\"When we make this spear, this one that enables us to cut a path into this landscape, we actually need two sides of the story, the L-O-R-E and the L-A-W.\"\n\n## The Power of Listening Together\n\nFor Richard, the creation of \"our story\" depends on deep, respectful listening:\n\n\"That story is dependent though in its practice for entities to hold each other's story in balance or gently, if that makes any sense, and respectful conversations. It's not to say, I am the one who knows and you need to jump through. It's about, hey I've got something that I'm going to offer you and you can choose to take that story or you can choose not to take that story.\"\n\nHe emphasises that listening must go beyond mere hearing:\n\n\"It's about understanding the story of the other in a way that you might not have that answer, but you go, ah, I can see you, see me see you. And it's about trying to see one in someone, but not, and to hold that other gently. And conversely, if that's switched the other way around, then I think you've got a powerful space for conversation.\"\n\n## Leading Through Cultural Practice\n\nAs leader of the Manbarra Operations, Richard applies these cultural frameworks to modern organisational development:\n\n\"As we then build organisations, we've got a young organisation, Manbarra Operations, we then can figure out... we're hunting for particular fish. So we want the Goggin who understands how to do finance, the Goggin who understands business, and the one who helps us shape policies and procedures.\"\n\nHe teaches his team to navigate complexity through cultural understanding:\n\n\"I say to my cousin brothers or who I'm talking to or my colleagues or the workers under me, we've got to navigate these two wells but for you to understand these two wells you've got to navigate these two worlds. But for you to understand these two worlds, you've got to know your own world.\"\n\n## The Pebble Philosophy\n\nRichard shares the story of the pebble—a teaching about minding one's impact when entering another's country:\n\n\"Don't come to someone else's country as a rock or a boulder, but as a pebble, so that your footprint is small. But when you leave, that person says, 'Oh, that one came, your presence is great, and there's a heart. He came and didn't make a ripple. So he's welcome anytime.'\"\n\nWhen asked about his own legacy, he embodies this philosophy:\n\n\"I want to be the smallest pebble I can be, the sharpest stone, the one that has the least impact... my footprint would be that no one knew that I was here in the first place and that'd be pretty cool.\"\n\n## Future Vision\n\nFor the land where he works, Richard envisions restoration and regeneration:\n\n\"We're planning to minimise that boulder and the impact of that rock and restore this country... the country is restoring itself and regenerating itself.\"\n\nHis leadership focuses on empowering the next generation:\n\n\"The goal will be that in this space, some of our young people from Palm will be inspired to imagine what this place might look like... I'll hopefully accord and release some of those Banams to be Goggins of this place and they can work out what that might look like.\"\n\nRichard ultimately sees his role as that of a navigator—helping others find their own path while respecting the wisdom of country:\n\n\"The answers are in country and you just got to look around and find that... part of the role is, for me in this space, is as a navigator, is being a guide... it's about having respectful conversations and understanding the story of the other.\"",

State governments in Australia originated from British colonial administrations that federated in 1901.*\n\n## Historical Context\n\nAustralia’s state governments trace their roots to the six self-governing British colonies that existed in the 19th century. By the late 1800s each colony (including Queensland, established as a separate colony in 1859) had its own parliament and laws, though they remained under British oversight ([The Federation of Australia - Parliamentary Education Office](https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/history-of-parliament/federation/the-federation-of-australia#:~:text=For%20at%20least%2060%20000,power%20of%20the%20British%20Parliament)). On 1 January 1901, these six colonies – Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia – **united to form the Commonwealth of Australia** under a federal system ([The Federation of Australia - Parliamentary Education Office](https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/history-of-parliament/federation/the-federation-of-australia#:~:text=Australia%20became%20a%20nation%20on,process%20is%20known%20as%20Federation)) ([Federation of Australia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Australia#:~:text=The%20Federation%20of%20Australia%20was,and%20the)). Upon Federation, the former colonies became states and **retained their systems of government** (with their legislatures and institutions largely intact), while a new national Commonwealth government took responsibility for matters affecting the whole nation ([Federation of Australia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Australia#:~:text=The%20Federation%20of%20Australia%20was,and%20the)). This arrangement was a compromise intended to balance national unity with regional autonomy. Over time, state governments have evolved but remain central to Australia’s governance. For example, Queensland is unique in that it **abolished its upper house (Legislative Council) in 1922**, leaving a single-house Parliament – making it the only Australian state with a unicameral legislature ([1.4 The power of the Parliament of Queensland - Legislation ...](https://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/publications/categories/policies-and-codes/handbooks/legislation-handbook/context/power-of-parliament.aspx#:~:text=,having%20been%20abolished%20in%201922)). Despite such changes, the fundamental role of state governments established at Federation – managing regional affairs within the federal system – has endured for well over a century.\n\n## Necessity and Function of State Governments\n\nState governments exist as an integral tier of Australia’s federal structure, with constitutionally defined roles and responsibilities. The Australian Constitution enumerates certain powers for the Commonwealth (federal) government (e.g. defense, foreign affairs, currency, immigration), and all other legislative powers default to the states ([The Roles and Responsibilities of Federal, State and Local Governments](https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/about/Pages/The-Roles-and-Responsibilities-of-Federal-State-a.aspx#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Government)). This means that **states are responsible for a wide range of domestic matters** that directly affect citizens’ daily lives. Major state responsibilities include public hospitals and health services, primary and secondary education, policing and criminal law, roads and public transport, land use and environmental management, utilities, and emergency services ([The Roles and Responsibilities of Federal, State and Local Governments](https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/about/Pages/The-Roles-and-Responsibilities-of-Federal-State-a.aspx#:~:text=Under%20the%20Australian%20Constitution%2C%20the,out%20its%20system%20of%20government)). Each state operates under its own constitution and parliamentary system, allowing it to legislate on these areas to suit local needs ([The Roles and Responsibilities of Federal, State and Local Governments](https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/about/Pages/The-Roles-and-Responsibilities-of-Federal-State-a.aspx#:~:text=Under%20the%20Australian%20Constitution%2C%20the,out%20its%20system%20of%20government)).\n\nThe existence of state governments reflects both historical necessity and functional advantages. Australia is a vast and geographically diverse country; having regional governments enables laws and policies to be tailored to different conditions and communities. As one commentator noted, *Australia’s great diversity in climate, resources, terrain, and population density means needs and problems differ between regions – providing justification for devolution through state governments* ([Awardees’ gratitudeHere](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/51257975/the-murray-darling-basin-worth-saving-order-of-australia-/21#:~:text=Scots%20to%20share%20thewealth%20from,spend%20more%20in%20the%20UK)). In other words, **state governments allow flexibility and local adaptation** in policymaking that a single central government might struggle to provide for such a large country. States also serve as an additional layer of democratic representation and accountability. They have their own elected parliaments and executives, which can respond to regional issues more directly than the distant federal government. Moreover, federalism creates a degree of healthy balance: powers are divided between federal and state authorities, which can act as a check on over-concentration of power. Legal scholars argue that this division *“prevents the abuse of power by dividing it”* and ensures a **balance of perspectives** in governance, as different state governments can pursue different policies and share best practices ([Awardees’ gratitudeHere](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/51257975/the-murray-darling-basin-worth-saving-order-of-australia-/21#:~:text=potential,to%20meetemerging%20needs%20in%20a)). For example, one state might trial an innovative program (in health, education, etc.), providing a model that others can learn from or avoid. This capacity for policy experimentation and regional initiative is often cited as a benefit of maintaining state governments. In summary, the state tier of government in Australia exists to manage important functions closer to the community, to reflect regional diversity, and to uphold a federal balance of power within the nation.\n\n## Arguments Against State Government\n\nWhile state governments are deeply embedded in Australia’s system, there is ongoing debate about whether this layer of government is truly necessary in its current form. Critics who question the need for state governments often argue that Australia is **“over-governed”** for its population, pointing out the potential duplication, cost, and complexity of having federal, state, *and* local governments. Proposals for reform range from altering state boundaries to outright abolishing state governments in favor of a two-tier system (national and local). The key arguments against the state level typically include:\n\n- **Local Decision-Making and Grassroots Engagement**: Detractors contend that governance would be more democratic and responsive if more power was shifted to local communities rather than centralized at the state level. Local governments are the closest to the people and often have a better on-the-ground understanding of community needs. They can foster grassroots participation in decision-making that large state bureaucracies might overlook. The Australian Local Government Association, for instance, emphasizes that as *“the level of government closest to the community”*, local councils have the greatest opportunity to engage people at a **grassroots level** and work collaboratively for public good (). Abolishing state governments could **empower regional and local authorities**, ensuring that decisions about services like planning, schools, and policing are made by those living in the affected communities. Proponents argue this bottom-up approach would lead to more tailored solutions and greater public trust, as citizens feel a direct connection to their governance.\n\n- **Decentralization and Efficiency**: Another argument is that removing a tier of government would streamline administration and reduce bureaucratic overlap. In the current federal system, responsibilities often blur between federal and state (and state and local), leading to duplication of agencies and “buck-passing” of blame between levels of government ([Awardees’ gratitudeHere](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/51257975/the-murray-darling-basin-worth-saving-order-of-australia-/21#:~:text=effect%20the%20financial%20powerprovides%20a,the%20matters%20as%20the%20exclusive)) ([Awardees’ gratitudeHere](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/51257975/the-murray-darling-basin-worth-saving-order-of-australia-/21#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWith%20trepidation%2C%20I%20venture%20to,strong%3E%20climate%2C%20resources)). A more decentralized model (with only national and local governments) could clarify who is accountable for what and cut down on regulatory complexity. Even some prominent figures have questioned the necessity of states. Former Prime Minister John Howard once observed that Australia’s *“founding fathers were probably wrong to saddle us with states”*, though he noted it may be too late to fully undo it ([Awardees’ gratitudeHere](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/51257975/the-murray-darling-basin-worth-saving-order-of-australia-/21#:~:text=Abolish%20the%20States%20and%20save,advanced%20is%20that%20weare%20over)). Similarly, former PM Bob Hawke has been a long-time advocate for reorganizing or even **abolishing the states** to modernize governance ([Awardees’ gratitudeHere](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/51257975/the-murray-darling-basin-worth-saving-order-of-australia-/21#:~:text=Abolish%20the%20States%20and%20save,strong%3Efer%20the%20following)). Their view is that a unified national framework, combined with empowered local governments, could deliver services more uniformly and **eliminate inter-governmental disputes** over funding and responsibility. In practical terms, a two-tier system might also decentralise the location of government services – for example, federal departments could have regional branches, and local councils could take on roles like managing schools or hospitals, potentially bringing decision-makers closer to the service delivery point.\n\n- **Financial Savings**: A major point in the debate is the **cost of maintaining state governments**. Running eight separate state/territory governments (six states plus the ACT and NT) entails significant expenditure on parliaments, bureaucracies, and duplicate departments. Several analyses have attempted to quantify how much Australia could save by eliminating the state layer. One comprehensive study by Dr. Mark Drummond (2008) estimated that **around $50 billion could be saved each year** if Australia scrapped the state governments and moved to a streamlined national-local system ([BraveNewClimate - BraveNewClimate](https://bravenewclimate.com/2010/04/22/ifr-fad-4/#:~:text=So%20assuming%2030%20reactors%20,Local%202%20tiered%20government%20system)). This figure includes savings from cutting a large number of politicians, senior public servants, and administrative support, as well as reducing overlapping programs and regulatory frameworks. Even if such estimates are debated, the potential savings are undeniably large. Queensland’s portion of these costs is substantial: the **Queensland Parliamentary Service alone costs about $130–$140 million per year** to operate ([LAQ 2024-25 SDS](https://budget.qld.gov.au/files/Budget_2024-25_SDS_Legislative_Assembly_of_Queensland.pdf#:~:text=Total%20expenses%20are%20estimated%20to,93%20additional%20electorate%20office%20staff)), and that is just the legislature and associated support, not the entirety of the state’s administrative apparatus. If the state government were abolished, proponents argue, much of this money could be redirected to frontline services or returned to taxpayers. For example, instead of funding two health or education departments (federal and state), a single integrated system could be more cost-effective. Supporters of this view often cite examples like the United States, where some individual states govern populations far larger than Australia’s with a single legislature – implying that Australia’s multiple state governments might be an unnecessary luxury. Indeed, advocates note that **Californians (population ~39 million) get by with one state government, whereas Australia (population ~26 million) maintains eight legislatures** – suggesting room to trim excess ([BraveNewClimate - BraveNewClimate](https://bravenewclimate.com/2010/04/22/ifr-fad-4/#:~:text=%2450%20billion%20here%2C%20%2450%20billion,need%2014%20times%20the%20government)). Of course, opponents of abolition respond that many of these “savings” would be offset by the need to expand federal agencies or local bodies to take over state functions, but the net financial argument remains a centerpiece for those against the state status quo.\n\n## Youth Justice System Focus\n\nDebates about state versus local control often highlight specific policy areas, and **youth justice in Queensland** has become a case in point. Queensland currently faces significant challenges with youth crime and detention, raising questions about whether the state-run system is effective or if more localised, community-based approaches could work better. As of mid-2023, Queensland had the highest number of young people in detention of any Australian jurisdiction – **around 300 youths detained on an average night** ([Youth detention population in Australia 2023, State and territory trends](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/youth-justice/youth-detention-population-in-australia-2023/contents/state-and-territory-trends#:~:text=trends%20www,96%29%3B%20the%20Northern)). The state operates three youth detention centres (in Brisbane, Townsville, and Cairns), which are frequently at or over capacity. These facilities house roughly **306 young offenders** at any given time when full (). The cost of running Queensland’s youth detention system is very high: it costs about **$1,880 per day to detain one young person**, adding up to roughly **$210 million per year** to keep 306 youths incarcerated (). This figure does not even include the broader youth justice spending on courts, police, and supervision – it is solely the cost of detention beds. By any measure, this is a heavy investment. Yet despite the expense, outcomes have been poor. A recent independent report described Queensland’s current detention-centric model as *“the most expensive and least effective solution to youth crime that we have designed”* ([Damning report reveals Qld youth detention ‘most expensive, least effective’ — EducationHQ](https://educationhq.com/news/damning-report-reveals-qld-youth-detention-most-expensive-least-effective-175965/#:~:text=The%20Queensland%20Family%20and%20Child,crime%20that%20we%20have%20designed%E2%80%9D)). Around **90% of young offenders in Queensland reoffend after release** from detention, one of the highest recidivism rates in the country ([Damning report reveals Qld youth detention ‘most expensive, least effective’ — EducationHQ](https://educationhq.com/news/damning-report-reveals-qld-youth-detention-most-expensive-least-effective-175965/#:~:text=The%20report%20said%20in%202020%2F21,26%20per%20cent)). Such statistics suggest that the state-run approach of detaining troubled youth is yielding disappointing results in terms of rehabilitation or public safety.\n\nThese concerns have prompted exploration of alternative models that shift away from a pure state custody approach toward **local support hubs and community-based interventions**. One illustrative case is a community initiative in Townsville called *Fearless Towards Success (FTS)* – a grassroots program aimed at serious repeat youth offenders. FTS operates a local support centre (or “hub”) that provides wraparound services for high-risk youths, many of whom are well-known to the justice system. Instead of focusing on punishment, the program prioritises **intensive personal support**: it offers a safe space, mentorship (often by staff with lived experience), cultural connection for Indigenous youth, life-skills training, education and employment pathways, and consistent long-term relationship building. The philosophy is to address the underlying issues – trauma, family instability, mental health, substance abuse, lack of skills – that often drive young people into crime () (). Proponents note that *“a one size fits all approach doesn’t work”* for the most challenging 10% of offenders (), and that **no one was truly listening to these youths** under the traditional system (). Programs like FTS aim to fill that gap by tailoring support to each individual. Crucially, advocates point out the economic logic: Queensland is currently **“happy to pay $13,000 a week to detain a youth”**, but invests comparatively little in proactive support on release () (). If even a fraction of the $210 million annual detention cost were reallocated to community programs, far more young people could be engaged in positive activities. As the FTS submission to Parliament bluntly asked, *can’t we do better with a $210 million investment spread across just 306 kids?* (). The suggestion is that **locally-run support hubs** could achieve better outcomes at lower cost by keeping youths out of expensive detention in the first place. Early indications are promising – while quantitative results for the new FTS model are still being gathered, qualitative feedback shows better engagement of youth who previously revolved through the detention system (many find the community hub a more trusting environment than state-run programs) () ().\n\nAnother instructive example comes from outside Queensland: the **Maranguka Justice Reinvestment project in Bourke, NSW**. This initiative, while not about abolishing state government, demonstrates how empowering a local community to tackle youth offending can yield significant benefits. Bourke’s program, led by local Aboriginal leaders, redirected funds that would have been spent on prisons and detention into *community-driven solutions* – things like an Early Years family center, free driving lessons for teens (to reduce unlicensed driving offenses), local employment and education programs, and community policing partnerships ([Justice Reinvestment Helps Reduce Crime in Bourke](https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/justice-reinvestment-helps-reduce-crime-in-bourke/#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20the%20Maranguka,youth%20crime%20and%20domestic%20violence)) ([Justice Reinvestment Helps Reduce Crime in Bourke](https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/justice-reinvestment-helps-reduce-crime-in-bourke/#:~:text=Police%20have%20helpfully%20paired%20up,prevent%20violence%20before%20it%20happens)). The results were dramatic. In just a few years, this **holistic, place-based strategy** contributed to major drops in crime: between 2015 and 2017, youth *major offenses* fell by 18%, non-domestic assault rates fell **34%**, domestic violence incidents fell **39%**, and drug offenses dropped **39%**, among other improvements ([Justice Reinvestment Helps Reduce Crime in Bourke](https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/justice-reinvestment-helps-reduce-crime-in-bourke/#:~:text=The%20initiatives%20have%20been%20instrumental,drops%20between%202015%20and%202017)). Reoffending rates also declined as more at-risk individuals were diverted into support programs instead of cycling through custody ([Justice Reinvestment Helps Reduce Crime in Bourke](https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/justice-reinvestment-helps-reduce-crime-in-bourke/#:~:text=The%20results)) ([Justice Reinvestment Helps Reduce Crime in Bourke](https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/justice-reinvestment-helps-reduce-crime-in-bourke/#:~:text=Rates%20of%20reoffending%20have%20also,fallen%20significantly)).",

This trend indicates a growing reliance on youth detention as a response to youth crime. In 2023, the average daily cost of detaining a young offender in Queensland was over $1,834, or $669,308 per year. This is significantly higher than the national average of $3,320 per day in 2023-24.\n\n### Community Safety\n\nWhile detailed historical data on community safety spending is limited, the available information suggests a trend of increasing investment in this area.\n\n- The 2024-25 budget allocates a record $4.379 billion for Police and Community Safety, representing an increase of almost $700 million, or 15 percent, over the last financial year.\n\nThis significant increase reflects the government's commitment to enhancing community safety through increased police presence, improved resources, and support for community-based initiatives.\n\n### Youth Crime Prevention\n\nHistorical data reveals a substantial investment in youth crime prevention initiatives over the years.\n\n- From 2015 to 2023-24, the government invested $1.4 billion in whole-of-government funding for youth justice initiatives, including various intervention and diversionary programs.\n\nThis sustained investment highlights the government's ongoing efforts to address youth crime through a multi-faceted approach that includes prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation.\n\n### Residential Care\n\nHistorical spending data for residential care reveals a concerning trend of increasing costs and a growing number of children in care.\n\n- In the 2023-24 financial year, there was a predicted half a billion dollar budget blowout in residential care for vulnerable children.\n- The cost of residential care has been steadily increasing, with the government spending just shy of a billion dollars last financial year.\n- There has been a decade-long increase in the number of children under 12 living in residential care across Queensland.\n\nThis trend raises concerns about the financial sustainability of the residential care system and the need for more effective prevention and early intervention programs to reduce the number of children entering care.\n\n### Youth Community Programs\n\nWhile historical data on youth community program spending is limited, the government has consistently invested in programs that support young people's wellbeing, education, and participation in the community. These programs play a crucial role in providing young people with opportunities for personal development, social inclusion, and positive engagement.\n\n## Program Effectiveness\n\nThis section evaluates the effectiveness of various government programs and initiatives in the areas of youth detention, youth crime prevention, and youth community programs.\n\n### Youth Detention\n\nDespite the significant investment in youth detention, reoffending rates remain high, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the current detention model.\n\n- Almost 69 percent of youths released from detention reoffend and return to supervision within 12 months.\n- A report by the Queensland Family and Child Commission found that Queensland's youth detention system is \"largely ineffective\" and has one of Australia's biggest reoffending rates.\n- The report described the current detention model as \"the most expensive and least effective solution to youth crime that we have designed.\"\n\nThese findings suggest that the current detention model is not effectively rehabilitating young offenders and may be contributing to a cycle of reoffending. Factors contributing to these high recidivism rates include:\n\n- **Lack of focus on rehabilitation:** The current detention model prioritizes punishment and containment over rehabilitation.\n- **Inadequate support for reintegration:** Young people leaving detention often lack the support and resources they need to successfully reintegrate into the community.\n- **Underlying social and economic factors:** Many young people in detention have experienced trauma, poverty, family violence, and other challenges that contribute to their offending behavior.\n\n### Youth Crime Prevention\n\nThe effectiveness of youth crime prevention programs varies, and there is a need for more rigorous evaluation to determine which programs are most successful.\n\n- An independent review of the JT Academy's \"You Got This\" program found significant reductions in criminal offending by at-risk teenagers participating in the program in Cairns. This program provides practical advice on leadership, resume writing, interview skills, and career coaching, helping young people to develop positive life skills and avoid criminal behavior.\n- The Pathways to Prevention project demonstrated the long-term success of early prevention initiatives and community support for young children and families in reducing rates of involvement in serious youth crime. This project involved an enriched preschool program combined with family support, which led to a more than 50 percent reduction in youth offending.\n\nThese examples highlight the potential of well-designed and targeted programs to prevent youth crime and support young people in making positive choices.\n\n### Youth Community Programs\n\nSeveral reports highlight the positive impact of youth community programs on young people's wellbeing and development.\n\n- The Pathways to Prevention project found that an enriched preschool program combined with family support reduced the number of court-adjudicated youth offenders by more than 50 percent.\n- The Growing Up in Queensland report, published by the Queensland Family and Child Commission, provides a comprehensive overview of child, family, and community wellbeing across the state. This report highlights the positive impact of various community programs and initiatives on young people's lives.\n\nThese findings demonstrate the importance of investing in youth community programs that provide young people with opportunities for personal development, social inclusion, and positive engagement.\n\n## Alternative Approaches in Other Jurisdictions\n\nExamining alternative approaches to youth detention and youth crime prevention being used in other jurisdictions can provide valuable insights for Queensland.\n\nThe National Institute of Justice, in collaboration with Harvard Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management, has released \"The Future of Youth Justice: A Community-Based Alternative to the Youth Prison Model\". This report advocates for replacing the current youth prison model with a continuum of community-based programs and smaller, homelike facilities that prioritize age-appropriate rehabilitation.\n\nThe report highlights the \"4Rs\" approach: reduce, reform, replace, and reinvest. This approach involves:\n\n- **Reduce:** Reducing the number of young people in detention.\n- **Reform:** Reforming youth prisons to make them more humane and rehabilitative.\n- **Replace:** Replacing large youth prisons with smaller, community-based facilities.\n- **Reinvest:** Reinvesting resources in community-based programs that prevent youth crime and support young people's reintegration.\n\nSeveral states in the US, including Virginia, Texas, California, Ohio, and Missouri, have successfully implemented the \"4Rs\" approach, demonstrating that community-based alternatives can reduce recidivism, control costs, and promote public safety.\n\n## Analysis and Recommendations\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the Queensland government's spending on youth justice and community safety, followed by recommendations for improvement.\n\n### Youth Detention\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe analysis of Queensland's youth detention spending reveals several areas of concern:\n\n- **High cost and low effectiveness:** Despite the high cost of youth detention, reoffending rates remain high, indicating that the current model is not effectively rehabilitating young offenders.\n- **Overcrowding:** Queensland's youth detention centers are operating at near capacity, leading to increased use of police watch houses to detain young people. This raises concerns about the safety and wellbeing of young people in watch houses, which are not designed for long-term detention.\n- **Lack of focus on rehabilitation:** The current detention model prioritizes punishment and containment over rehabilitation, which may be contributing to high recidivism rates.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- **Invest in alternative approaches to detention:** The government should prioritize funding for community-based alternatives to detention, such as multisystemic therapy (MST), functional family therapy (FFT), and specialized foster care. These approaches have been shown to be effective in reducing recidivism and promoting young people's reintegration into the community.\n- **Increase focus on rehabilitation:** Youth detention centers should prioritize rehabilitation and reintegration by providing education, vocational training, and therapeutic services. This will help young people to develop the skills and support they need to successfully reintegrate into society.",

    "content": "# A Comparative Analysis of Youth Justice Systems in Spain and Australia\n\nYouth justice systems worldwide grapple with the complex challenge of balancing accountability for wrongdoing with the developmental needs of young offenders. This comparative analysis delves into the distinct approaches taken by Spain and Australia in addressing youth crime, examining their models, practices, and underlying principles. By exploring the differences in costs, outcomes, and recent reforms, this report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each system and draw key insights into effective youth justice policies.\n\n## Spanish Youth Justice System\n\n### Historical Context\n\nThe Spanish youth justice system has undergone a significant evolution throughout the 20th century. Emerging in the early 1900s, influenced by a wave of similar developments in Western Europe, the system initially adopted a tutelary approach grounded in positivism. This approach viewed young offenders as individuals in need of protection and reform, reflecting a shift away from purely punitive measures. However, the system's development was heavily shaped by the Franco dictatorship (1939-1975), which maintained a paternalistic and authoritarian model. Under this model, judges, acting as \"good pater familias,\" had broad discretion to intervene in the lives of young people deemed to be in need of \"correction,\" even in the absence of criminal offenses.\n\nFollowing the enactment of the 1978 Constitution, a period of debate and reflection led to the establishment of juvenile courts within the judicial system in 1985. This marked a move towards a more formalized and rights-based approach to youth justice. The current legal framework is governed by Organic Law 5/2000, which came into effect in 2001. This law, while initially conceived as progressive and aligning with international standards, has been criticized for embracing a more repressive approach in response to concerns about youth crime. For example, the minimum age of criminal responsibility in Spain is 14, while the United States has no minimum age, exposing juveniles to harsher penalties.\n\n### Models and Practices\n\nThe Spanish youth justice system operates on the principle of individualized responses, with a strong emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration. This is reflected in the characteristics of the responsibility model adopted by the system, which emphasizes accountability while prioritizing the young person's best interests and the goal of re-education. By law, youth detention centers are run by the public sector or non-profit organizations, ensuring that resources are primarily directed towards the care and rehabilitation of young people. Regional administrations have autonomy in placing children, typically within their own region, facilitating closer ties with families and communities.\n\nSentences are individualized based on the offense and the young person's social, psychological, and educational needs. The judiciary plays an active role in overseeing rehabilitation, communicating with detention centers and supervising programs. Detention centers prioritize education and activity, with young people typically spending 30 hours per week in formal education and engaging in various activities such as sports, horticulture, and arts.\n\nRisk assessment tools, such as the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY) and the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI), are used to assess the risk of recidivism and tailor interventions. The YLS/CMI, in particular, has been shown to be a valid predictor of criminal recidivism in the Spanish context. Studies using the YLS/CMI have identified four distinct risk profiles among young offenders: low-needs, antisocial/peers, psychosocial, and high-needs. These profiles differ in terms of gender, age, type of offense, and juvenile justice measure, allowing for more targeted interventions.\n\nFor minor crimes, penalties can include fines of up to €3,000 or community service orders of up to 30 days. The new law on judicial costs in Spain also applies to youth justice cases, with flat fees ranging from €100 to €300 for civil proceedings and variable fees based on the amount claimed in legal proceedings.\n\n### Restorative Justice\n\nSpain has incorporated restorative justice principles into its youth justice system. Articles 19 and 51.3 of Organic Law 5/2000 provide for mediation and conciliation in both the trial phase and the implementation of measures. Restorative justice programs aim to repair the harm caused by crime by involving the offender, the victim, and the community in the resolution process. These programs promote accountability, empathy, and a sense of responsibility for one's actions.\n\n### Costs\n\nWhile comprehensive data on the overall costs of the Spanish youth justice system is limited, some insights can be gleaned from available sources. For instance, a study by Diagrama Foundation, a non-profit organization running youth detention centers in Spain, reported an annual cost of €70,000 per child. This figure includes expenses related to education, rehabilitation programs, and staffing. Notably, the study highlighted that the Spanish system achieves cost savings by requiring fewer staff to maintain control due to its focus on positive relationships and rehabilitation.\n\n### Outcomes\n\nEvaluating the outcomes of the Spanish youth justice system requires consideration of recidivism rates and the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs. A 2019 study by Diagrama Foundation found that only 13.6% of youth released from their centers in the Murcia region reoffended within a 6-year period. This suggests that the system's emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration may be contributing to positive outcomes. Notably, there have been no reported juvenile suicides in Diagrama's youth justice facilities in Spain.\n\nFurther research has examined the profile of serious reoffenders in Spain. These individuals often have a moderate level of recidivism risk that increases over time. Crimes against property are the most frequent, and young people who begin their criminal trajectories with this type of crime tend to reoffend into adulthood.\n\n### Recent Reforms\n\nWhile Organic Law 5/2000 remains the primary legal framework, ongoing discussions and reforms address specific aspects of the youth justice system. These include:\n\n- **Raising the Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility:** While the current minimum age is 14, there have been calls to raise it to align with international standards.\n- **Strengthening Restorative Justice Practices:** Efforts are underway to expand the use of restorative justice approaches in various stages of the youth justice process, including training for justice professionals and the development of new models for conflict resolution.\n- **Improving Detention Center Conditions:** Recent reforms focus on enhancing the quality of education and rehabilitation programs in detention centers, with an emphasis on providing a supportive and therapeutic environment.\n\n## Australian Youth Justice System\n\n### Historical Context\n\nThe Australian youth justice system has evolved from a welfare-oriented model in the mid-20th century to a more justice-oriented approach in recent decades. This shift reflects a growing emphasis on accountability and punishment in response to community concerns about youth crime. However, the system continues to incorporate elements of both models, with variations in legislation, policies, and practices across different states and territories.\n\nResearch on the Australian youth justice system has covered a wide range of topics, including interagency cooperation, the impact of parental imprisonment, adverse childhood experiences, and the over-representation of Indigenous youth. The Australian Institute of Criminology has funded various research projects on youth justice, exploring areas such as diversion programs, restorative justice, and the impact of detention.\n\nIn Tasmania, there is a specific focus on addressing the over-representation of Aboriginal children and young people in the youth justice system. This includes working in partnership with Tasmanian Aboriginal people to ensure that young people are safe and supported to live culturally-rich and thriving lives.\n\n### Models and Practices\n\nThe Australian youth justice system operates under a dual model, incorporating elements of both welfare and justice approaches. This is reflected in the diverse range of interventions and programs available, including diversionary options, restorative justice conferences, and custodial sentences.\n\nPolice play a crucial role in the youth justice system, with powers to investigate, arrest, and charge young offenders. The National Youth Policing Model in Australia provides a framework for best practices in policing young people, emphasizing early intervention, diversion, and collaboration with other sectors. Key principles of this model include targeting policing efforts, responding to alcohol and drug abuse, enforcing road rules, and collaborating with communities.\n\nCourts have the authority to determine guilt and impose sentences, which can include community-based orders, detention, or fines. In determining whether to impose a custodial sentence, courts consider factors such as the seriousness of the offense, the young person's history of offending, and the availability of non-custodial options. Youth justice agencies are responsible for supervising young people on legal orders, both in the community and in detention.\n\nThe Australian youth justice system recognizes the importance of addressing the developmental needs of young people. This includes providing age-appropriate services, considering their limited experience and maturity, and applying child safe standards to ensure their safety and well-being.\n\n### Restorative Justice\n\nRestorative justice practices are increasingly used in the Australian youth justice system. Youth justice conferences, a form of restorative justice, bring together the young offender, the victim, and their families to discuss the offense and its impact. These conferences aim to repair harm, promote accountability, and develop a plan to prevent reoffending.\n\nRestorative justice in Australia is defined as a process where all parties with a stake in a particular offense come together to resolve collectively how to deal with the aftermath of the offense and its consequences. It aims to repair the harm caused by crime, involve offenders, victims, and communities in the criminal justice process, and provide a constructive intervention for juvenile offenders.\n\nYouth justice group conferencing programs exist in every Australian jurisdiction, including the ACT, Northern Territory, NSW, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia. These programs can be used at various stages of the justice process, including diversion from court, sentencing support, post-sentence meetings, and pre-release planning.\n\nRestorative justice practices can be applied in various ways, including victim-offender mediation, restorative justice conferences, talking circles, and restorative engagement. These practices are flexible and responsive to individual and community needs.\n\n### Costs\n\nThe cost of youth detention in Australia has been a subject of concern. In the 2023-24 financial year, the average daily cost per young person in detention was $2,827.47, with an annual cost exceeding $1 million. This high cost raises questions about the effectiveness of detention in achieving desired outcomes. The cost of youth detention has almost doubled since 2014-15, when it was $544 million.\n\nIn addition to detention costs, there are also expenses associated with community supervision. In 2021/22, the average cost per day for a young person to be supervised in the community in New South Wales was $293.15.\n\nThe estimated costs of various categories of juvenile crime in Australia, including car theft, household burglaries, vandalism, arson, and shoplifting, amount to a significant financial burden on the community.\n\n### Outcomes\n\nRecidivism rates remain a key indicator of the effectiveness of the Australian youth justice system. Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that 41% of young people aged 10-17 who were under sentenced youth justice supervision between 2000-01 and 2021-22 returned to sentenced supervision before turning 18. This highlights the ongoing challenge of preventing reoffending.\n\nRecidivism rates are higher among young people who have previously been on supervised orders and those who serve shorter sentences. Indigenous young people are also more likely to reoffend than their non-Indigenous peers.\n\nStudies have shown that rehabilitation programs for young offenders can be effective in reducing recidivism rates. However, these programs are often underfunded and may not be accessible to all young people who need them.\n\nResearch has also examined the characteristics of alleged and proven offending among 10-13-year-olds in Australia. This age group is predominantly involved in non-violent offenses, and there are significant opportunities to improve early intervention and support programs for these children.\n\n### Recent Reforms\n\nRecent reforms in the Australian youth justice system include:\n\n- **Raising the Age of Criminal Responsibility:** Several states and territories are considering raising the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 12 years, in line with international standards. The Australian Capital Territory has committed to raising the minimum age to 14. There are strong arguments for raising the age, including concerns about the cognitive development of young children and the potential for the justice system to exacerbate existing disadvantage. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has also called for raising the age to 14 in all jurisdictions.\n- **Expanding Diversion Programs:** There is a growing focus on diverting young people from the formal justice system through programs that address underlying needs and promote rehabilitation. Diversion programs can include warnings, youth justice conferences, community service, and support services.\n- **Improving Detention Center Conditions:** Reforms are underway to improve conditions in youth detention centers, with a focus on providing therapeutic care and addressing the over-representation of Indigenous young people. There are concerns about the punitive nature of youth justice systems in Australia and the use of practices such as solitary confinement.\n\n## Support Services for Young Offenders\n\nIn Australia, various organizations provide support services to young people in contact with the criminal justice system. The Shopfront Youth Legal Centre, for example, offers free legal services to homeless and disadvantaged young people aged 25 and under in Sydney. This service provides legal assistance, education, and social support to some of the most vulnerable young people in the community.\n\n## Challenges and Ethical Considerations in Research\n\nConducting research with young people released from youth justice detention in Australia presents unique challenges and ethical considerations. These include the need to ensure informed consent, protect confidentiality, and minimize any potential harm to participants. During a pandemic, there may be additional challenges related to access, safety, and the well-being of both researchers and participants.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n![Comparative Analysis Image](/images/articles/a-comparative-analysis-of-youth-justice-systems-in-spain-and-australia-2-e0df02e3.png)\n\n## Strengths and Weaknesses\n\n### Spain\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Focus on Rehabilitation:** The emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration is a key strength of the Spanish system. This approach aims to address the underlying causes of offending and provide young people with the support they need to lead law-abiding lives. For example, detention centers prioritize education and activity, with young people typically spending 30 hours per week in formal education.\n- **Individualized Responses:** The individualized approach to sentencing and case management ensures that interventions are tailored to the specific needs of each young person. This is reflected in the use of risk assessment tools like the SAVRY and YLS/CMI to assess individual needs and guide interventions.\n- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Evidence suggests that the Spanish system achieves cost savings through its focus on rehabilitation and positive relationships, requiring fewer staff to maintain control.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- **Repressive Tendencies:** Despite the focus on rehabilitation, concerns remain about the potential for repressive practices within the system, particularly given the historical influence of the Franco dictatorship.\n- **Limited Data:** More comprehensive data is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the Spanish youth justice system, particularly in terms of long-term outcomes for young people.\n\n### Australia\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Diversity of Interventions:** The dual model allows for a range of interventions and programs to be tailored to the specific needs of young offenders. This includes diversionary options, restorative justice conferences, and custodial sentences.\n- **Restorative Justice Practices:** Restorative justice practices are increasingly used in the Australian youth justice system. Youth justice conferences, a form of restorative justice, bring together the young offender, the victim, and their families to discuss the offense and its impact. These conferences aim to repair harm, promote accountability, and develop a plan to prevent reoffending.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- **High Costs:** The cost of youth detention in Australia is extremely high, raising questions about the effectiveness of detention in achieving desired outcomes.\n- **Indigenous Overrepresentation:** Indigenous young people are disproportionately represented in the Australian youth justice system, highlighting systemic failures and the need for targeted interventions.\n\nThis comparison underscores Spain’s success in prioritising rehabilitation and Australia’s ongoing struggles with punitive approaches, offering key lessons for future youth justice reforms.",

    "content": "# Diagrama Foundation's Impact on Spain's Youth Detention System\n\n![Diagrama Foundation](/images/articles/diagrama-foundations-impact-on-spains-youth-detention-system-1-81044f0a.jpg)\n\nThe Diagrama Foundation is a non-profit organization that has been working with young offenders in Spain since 1991. Over the past three decades, they have developed a unique approach to juvenile justice that prioritizes rehabilitation and reintegration over punishment. This report will provide a comprehensive overview of the Diagrama Foundation's history, outcomes, practices, and systems change efforts within Spain's youth detention system.\n\n## History of the Diagrama Foundation\n\nFounded in 1991, the Diagrama Foundation (\"Fundación Diagrama Intervención Psicosocial\") is a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting individuals in vulnerable situations and at risk of social exclusion. With a strong commitment to upholding and promoting human rights, their primary objective is to promote and develop centers, services, programs, and research aimed at the prevention, treatment, and integration of people facing challenging life circumstances, particularly children, young people, families, women, and dependents. Diagrama employs over 5,000 professionals in Spain, who, along with volunteers and collaborators, make up a team of close to 5,400 people dedicated to providing this service to society. Their vision is to be a benchmark for quality, commitment, good practice, and efficiency in the comprehensive care of vulnerable people, working towards their full social integration. To achieve this, the foundation has developed a specialized intervention model centered on the well-being of individuals and society, as well as the continuous improvement of its processes and resources.\n\nThe Diagrama Foundation's work aligns with the principles of restorative justice and youth rehabilitation. Their commitment to providing comprehensive support for vulnerable young people, including those in contact with the law, suggests a significant role in shaping Spain's approach to youth justice. This includes managing resources that promote the learning of knowledge, skills, values, and social norms, helping young people develop the framework for an autonomous and responsible life.\n\n## Outcomes of Diagrama Foundation's Work\n\nThe Diagrama Foundation has achieved remarkable outcomes in its work with young offenders in Spain. One notable achievement is their significantly lower recidivism rate compared to typical youth detention centers. A 2019 study found that only 13.6% of youth released from Diagrama centers in the Murcia region returned to custody over a 6-year period. This success can be attributed to their focus on rehabilitation and reintegration, which includes providing education, vocational training, and support for social and emotional development. This approach has been shown to improve the well-being of young people in their care. By creating a supportive and encouraging environment, they help young people develop a sense of self-worth and belonging, leading to positive behavioral changes and a reduction in re-offending.\n\nFurthermore, Diagrama's approach has been shown to be cost-effective. They employ far fewer staff than are usually required in juvenile detention centers, which typically represent the greatest cost in this sector.\n\nThese positive outcomes have garnered international attention. In 2023, Lord Bird MBE, a member of the UK House of Lords and advocate for social justice, visited Diagrama's facilities in Spain. He was impressed by their approach and the positive results they have achieved, noting the stark contrast between Diagrama's 80% non-re-offending rate and the UK's 30% rate.\n\nThis success can be attributed, in part, to the foundation's dedication to providing a supportive and educational environment rather than relying on traditional security measures. As David McGuire, Chief Executive of the Diagrama Foundation, stated, \"We know that juveniles serving custodial sentences need role models, education on the difference between right and wrong, and hope for the future, not security guards and cells.\"\n\n## Practices and Interventions\n\nTo achieve these positive outcomes, the Diagrama Foundation employs a variety of practices and interventions in its work with young offenders. These are summarized in the table below and elaborated upon further:\n\n![Practices and Interventions](/images/articles/diagrama-foundations-impact-on-spains-youth-detention-system-2-0a85306d.png)\n\nDiagrama's re-education centers prioritize education and skill-building to equip young people for a successful future. They recognize that each young person is an individual and provide personalized support to address their specific needs and challenges, including those related to education, family, health, and mental well-being.\n\nThe foundation's non-punitive ethos is crucial to their success. They believe in setting clear boundaries and expectations while providing genuine warmth, care, and encouragement. This approach fosters a sense of trust and respect, allowing young people to feel safe and supported as they work towards rehabilitation.\n\nFurthermore, Diagrama recognizes the importance of family and community in the rehabilitation process. They actively encourage and support contact and connection with family members, providing dedicated support to families as well. This helps young people maintain vital support networks and facilitates their reintegration into the community upon release.\n\n## Systems Change Efforts\n\nThe Diagrama Foundation has been a driving force for systems change within Spain's youth detention system. Their innovative approach has challenged traditional punitive models and promoted a more rehabilitative and restorative approach to youth justice. By demonstrating the effectiveness of their model, they have influenced policy and practice across Spain.\n\nOne of the key systems change efforts undertaken by Diagrama is the regionalization of facilities. This allows young people to be placed within their own area, maintaining connections with their support networks and facilitating their reintegration into the community. They also advocate for a more flexible system of sentencing and case management, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is not effective in addressing the diverse needs of young offenders.\n\nTo effectively implement Diagrama's methodology in other countries, a cultural shift in the perception of children who offend is necessary. This includes moving away from a purely punitive approach and embracing the importance of rehabilitation and education. It also requires a shift from corporate to not-for-profit providers, removing profit from the equation and prioritizing the quality of care and support provided to young people.\n\nLord Bird's visit to Diagrama's facilities in Spain highlights the growing recognition of the foundation's success in transforming youth justice. His advocacy for adopting similar models in other countries underscores the potential for Diagrama's approach to inspire change on a global scale.\n\n## International Collaboration and Research\n\nThe Diagrama Foundation actively engages in international collaboration and research to further its mission and contribute to the broader field of youth justice. One notable example is their involvement in the REVIJ project (Reparation to the victims in the European Juvenile Justice Systems). This project, led by Fundación Diagrama, involves collaboration with various European organizations to analyze and promote restorative justice practices, including victim reparation, within youth justice systems across Europe.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Diagrama Foundation has made significant contributions to Spain's youth detention system. Their focus on rehabilitation, reintegration, and individualized support has led to positive outcomes for young offenders, including lower recidivism rates and improved well-being. Their innovative practices and systems change efforts have transformed the landscape of youth justice in Spain, offering a promising model for other countries to emulate.\n\nThe foundation's success highlights the importance of moving away from punitive approaches to youth justice and embracing a more holistic, rehabilitative model. By prioritizing education, personal development, and community reintegration, Diagrama has demonstrated that it is possible to break the cycle of re-offending and help young people build a better future.\n\nThe Diagrama model has the potential to be adapted and implemented in other countries facing challenges in their youth justice systems. However, successful implementation requires a commitment to cultural change, a focus on non-punitive practices, and a willingness to invest in the well-being and future of young people. Further research and evaluation of Diagrama's model can provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking to improve youth justice outcomes globally.\n\nWhile this report draws on extensive research, specific reports from [International Juvenile Justice Observatory](https://www.oijj.org/en) did not yield directly relevant information on the Diagrama Foundation or its work within the Spanish youth detention system.\n\n### Works cited\n\n1.

    "excerpt": "This report provides a comparative overview of youth detention and youth justice models in six European countries: Spain, Portugal, Greece, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany.",
    "content": "# Youth Detention and Youth Justice Models in Europe: A Comparative Overview\n\nThis report provides a comparative overview of youth detention and youth justice models in six European countries: Spain, Portugal, Greece, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. It examines the effectiveness of these systems, including recidivism rates and best practices, while also analysing challenges, limitations, and cost-effectiveness. This analysis also considers other relevant European models and the challenges of comparing youth justice systems across different countries.\n\n## Spain\n\n### Overview\n\nSpain's youth justice system has undergone significant changes since its inception in the early 20th century. Initially, the system employed a tutelary approach, focusing on the protection and guidance of young offenders. However, with the passage of Organic Law 5/2000, the system shifted towards a more repressive model. This law established the age of criminal responsibility at 14, with those under this age falling under the jurisdiction of social services.\n\nYouth detention centers in Spain are primarily managed by the public sector or non-profit organizations, such as the Diagrama Foundation. These organizations play a crucial role in providing care and rehabilitation services to young offenders. While regional administrations have autonomy in placing children within the justice system, they typically prioritize keeping them within their own region to maintain family ties and facilitate community integration.\n\n### Effectiveness\n\nReoffending rates among young people in Spain vary from 5% to 34%, depending on factors such as the nature of the offense, individual risk factors, and the effectiveness of interventions. Studies suggest a slightly higher prevalence of property crimes compared to crimes against persons. Notably, a 2019 study found a recidivism rate of 13.6% over six years for youth released from Diagrama centers in the Murcia region, significantly lower than typical rates.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nSpain's youth justice system emphasizes re-education and rehabilitation as its primary goals. Detention centers prioritize education, with young people receiving an average of 30 hours of formal education per week, in addition to social education and opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nThe Diagrama Foundation offers a noteworthy model, operating centers that focus on education, positive relationships, and individualized support. This approach has been shown to contribute to lower recidivism rates and a reduced need for restraint or force. Notably, judges, lawyers, and prosecutors in Spain actively monitor the progress of young people in detention, which may contribute to increased accountability and improved rehabilitation outcomes.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations\n\nDespite its focus on rehabilitation, Spain's youth justice system faces several challenges. These include ensuring the consistent application of laws across different regions, improving victim protection services, and adapting to evolving crime trends, particularly in the realm of cybercrime. There are also concerns about rising youth crime rates, including sexual aggression, inter-family violence, and technology-driven bullying.\n\nLimitations of the system include a lack of procedural guarantees in the early tutelary system and potential variability in resources and training across regions. The National Preventive Mechanism has also identified areas for improvement in youth detention centers, such as staff training in child restraint techniques and the provision of child-friendly spaces.\n\n### Cost-Effectiveness\n\nWhile specific data on cost-effectiveness is limited, the reliance on public sector and non-profit providers in youth detention aims to maximize the impact of allocated funds for care and rehabilitation.\n\n![Spain Youth Justice](/images/articles/youth-detention-and-youth-justice-models-in-europe-a-comparative-overview-1-491688d5.jpg)\n\n## Portugal\n\n### Overview\n\nPortugal's youth justice system has undergone a transformation from a punitive approach to a welfare-oriented model that prioritizes rehabilitation and the protection of children's rights. This shift reflects a growing recognition of the developmental needs of young people and the importance of providing support and opportunities for reintegration.\n\nHistorically, Portugal's youth justice system followed a paternalist-repressive approach, with limited practical application of educational measures. However, with increased awareness of child rights and the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, the system transitioned towards a welfare model.\n\nThe minimum age of criminal responsibility in Portugal is 16, with a special criminal regime in place for young people aged 16 to 21. The Educational Guardianship Law (LTE) serves as a guide for interventions with young offenders, emphasizing education and social reintegration.\n\n### Effectiveness\n\nPortugal's youth justice system generally aligns with age-appropriate justice principles, including mandatory individual assessments for young offenders. However, it is important to note that the availability of resources for conducting these assessments may pose a challenge, potentially impacting their quality or causing delays.\n\nOne of the key challenges facing the Portuguese system is the presence of children in adult prisons due to the lower age of criminal responsibility compared to other European countries. This raises concerns about the potential negative impact of such placements on young people's development and well-being.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nPortugal's youth justice system prioritizes the reintegration and rehabilitation of children, with deprivation of liberty used only as a last resort. The system employs different procedures for different age groups, ensuring that interventions are tailored to the specific needs and developmental stages of young people.\n\nPolice guidelines in Portugal provide best practices for interviewing children, emphasizing the importance of protecting their rights and well-being. These guidelines highlight the need for age-appropriate communication, avoiding unnecessary stress and prioritizing the child's best interests.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations\n\nChallenges facing Portugal's youth justice system include a lack of specialized training for professionals involved in youth justice and potential delays in individual assessments due to limited resources. There are also concerns about the effective implementation of educational measures and ensuring that interventions adequately address the social realities of young offenders.\n\nLimitations of the system include the presence of children in adult prisons and a lack of clarity regarding the application of corrective measures for 16 to 18-year-olds.\n\n### Cost-Effectiveness\n\nWhile specific data on cost-effectiveness is limited, the emphasis on alternatives to imprisonment and community-based interventions suggests a focus on cost-effective solutions.\n\n## Greece\n\n### Overview\n\nGreece's youth justice system operates under the Penal Code, with a minimum age of criminal responsibility of 12. The system is grounded in legal and sociological principles, with a focus on providing assistance, re-education, and therapy for young offenders. International standards and restorative justice principles have influenced the development of the Greek system, promoting a more holistic and rehabilitative approach.\n\nJuveniles in Greece are typically detained in special facilities separate from adult prisons. This separation aims to protect young people from the negative influences of adult prison environments and provide them with age-appropriate care and support.\n\nThe Greek system emphasizes the use of reformatory and therapeutic measures, with detention in special juvenile prisons reserved for minors over 15 in exceptional cases. This reflects a preference for community-based interventions and a focus on addressing the underlying causes of offending behavior.\n\n### Effectiveness\n\nThe Greek youth justice system faces challenges related to the complexity of legal instruments, frequent legal changes, and a lack of specialized services and institutions for children in contact with the law. There are concerns about high recidivism rates and limited data on the effectiveness of interventions.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nGreece promotes the use of restorative justice measures, such as victim-offender mediation, as an alternative to traditional criminal justice processes. However, the use of victim-offender mediation in practice is limited due to various factors, including a lack of resources and challenges in coordinating with victims and their families.\n\nThe system prioritizes community-based sanctions over custodial measures, aiming to keep young people connected to their communities and support their reintegration. It also seeks to address the underlying causes of offending behavior through individualized interventions and support services.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations\n\nChallenges facing the Greek youth justice system include a lack of juvenile probation officers, excessive use of pre-trial detention, and inadequate conditions in juvenile detention centers. There are concerns about the effectiveness of the justice system in protecting unaccompanied minors and addressing the root causes of gender-based violence.\n\nLimitations of the system include a lack of specialized services for preventing juvenile delinquency and victimization and potential inconsistencies in the application of laws and procedures. The Greek penal code characterizes felonies committed by juveniles as misdemeanors, which may facilitate their social reintegration but also raises concerns about the adequacy of punishment for serious offenses.\n\n### Cost-Effectiveness\n\nWhile specific data is limited, there are concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the Greek youth justice system due to a lack of resources, inadequate facilities, and limited access to specialized services.\n\n## Sweden\n\n### Overview\n\nSweden's youth justice system is deeply rooted in principles of child welfare and rehabilitation. The legal framework emphasizes the rights of the child and prioritizes a holistic approach that considers the young person's social situation and needs.\n\nThere is no criminal responsibility for individuals under the age of 15 in Sweden. Social authorities play a crucial role in handling youth under 15 who commit offenses, providing support and interventions such as care orders and family support. For young offenders aged 15 and above, social services continue to be involved in providing assessments and recommendations to the court.\n\nWhile young offenders are tried in the same courts as adults, the system provides special consideration for their age and maturity. This includes a focus on diversion from prosecution, the use of alternative sanctions, and a strong emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration.\n\n### Effectiveness\n\nSweden has a relatively low youth incarceration rate and prioritizes non-custodial measures. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of treatment programs and the lack of transparency in decision-making processes. Additionally, despite the emphasis on non-custodial measures, there are concerns about the increasing involvement of young people in serious crime, particularly those linked to criminal networks.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nSweden's youth justice system prioritizes diversion from prosecution and the use of alternative sanctions, such as youth contracts and youth service. Youth contracts are agreements between the young offender and social services that outline specific conditions and interventions, such as therapy, substance abuse treatment, or community service, as alternatives to detention. Youth service involves carrying out unpaid work for a specified number of hours under the supervision of social services.\n\nThe system emphasizes a holistic approach to youth justice, considering the young person's overall social situation and needs, rather than focusing solely on the offense committed. This approach aims to address the underlying factors that contribute to offending behavior and provide support for the young person's development and reintegration.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations\n\nChallenges facing Sweden's youth justice system include rising youth crime rates, particularly those linked to criminal networks, and the recruitment of young people into gangs. There are concerns about the detrimental effects of confinement on young people's development and well-being.\n\nLimitations of the system include a lack of specialized juvenile courts and potential inconsistencies in the application of laws and procedures across regions.\n\n### Cost-Effectiveness\n\nWhile specific data is limited, the emphasis on non-custodial measures and community-based interventions suggests a focus on cost-effective solutions.\n\n## Denmark\n\n### Overview\n\nDenmark's approach to youth justice differs from many other European countries in that it does not have a separate juvenile justice system. Young offenders are generally dealt with in the same courts as adults, but with special consideration for their age and circumstances.\n\nThe age of criminal responsibility in Denmark is 15. Offenders under this age are handled by social welfare authorities, who provide support and interventions based on the young person's needs.\n\nSeveral government ministries play a role in developing and implementing youth justice policies in Denmark, reflecting a multi-agency approach to addressing youth crime. This includes the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Social Affairs, Housing and Senior Citizens, the Ministry of Children and Education, and the Ministry of Justice.\n\n### Effectiveness\n\nYouth crime rates in Denmark have been stable or declining, and the system prioritizes rehabilitation over punishment. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of recent reforms and the potential negative impact of labeling young people as criminals.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nDenmark's youth justice system emphasizes diversion from prosecution and the use of alternative sanctions, such as fines, suspended sentences, and youth contracts. Youth contracts are agreements between the young offender, their parents, social services, and the police that outline specific conditions and interventions as an alternative to prosecution.\n\nThe system promotes a quick and coordinated response to youth crime through Youth Crime Boards (YCBs) and a Youth Probation Service (YPS). YCBs are composed of a judge, a police representative, and a child welfare representative, and they assess the need for social interventions to prevent future criminal behavior. The YPS provides supervision and support to young people who have been through the YCB process.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations\n\nChallenges facing Denmark's youth justice system include ensuring the protection of child rights within the system and addressing the needs of minors with psychiatric diagnoses. There are concerns about the potential negative impact of the new youth crime prevention law on the authority of child welfare services.\n\nLimitations of the system include a lack of specialized juvenile courts and potential inconsistencies in the application of laws and procedures across regions.\n\n### Cost-Effectiveness\n\nDenmark's system demonstrates cost-effectiveness through its emphasis on non-custodial measures and community-based interventions.\n\n## Germany\n\n### Overview\n\nGermany's youth justice system operates under the Juvenile Justice Act (JJA), with a minimum age of criminal responsibility of 14. The system is characterized by a dual approach that combines elements of welfare and justice models. This means that young offenders are seen as both needing support and being accountable for their actions.\n\nThe JJA emphasizes education and rehabilitation, with a focus on diverting young offenders from further involvement in the justice system. This is achieved through a range of measures, including warnings, community service, and educational programs.\n\nYouth Welfare Offices (YWO) play a significant role in the German youth justice system, providing support and interventions for troubled youth who may be at risk of offending. YWOs have the authority to implement both residential and non-residential measures, such as counseling, educational guidance, and placement in foster care or residential homes.\n\n### Effectiveness\n\nGermany has a low youth incarceration rate and prioritizes community sanctions and restorative justice measures. The system has been successful in reducing recidivism rates and promoting the social reintegration of young offenders. Research in Germany indicates that young offenders who are incarcerated have higher rates of recidivism than those given alternative sanctions.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nGermany's youth justice system provides specialized juvenile courts and prosecutors, with a focus on individualized interventions and due process guarantees. Juvenile judges and prosecutors receive specialized training to ensure they understand the developmental needs of young people and can make informed decisions about their cases.\n\nThe system emphasizes a holistic approach, considering the offender's background, development, and social environment when making decisions about interventions and sanctions. This approach aims to address the underlying factors that contribute to offending behavior and provide support for the young person's rehabilitation and reintegration.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations\n\nChallenges facing Germany's youth justice system include addressing rising crime rates among children and young people and ensuring the effective implementation of diversionary measures. There are concerns about the potential negative impact of punitive approaches on young offenders' rehabilitation.\n\nLimitations of the system include potential disparities in sentencing practices across regions and a lack of clarity regarding the definition of \"education\" within the JJA.\n\n### Cost-Effectiveness\n\nGermany's system demonstrates cost-effectiveness through its emphasis on diversion, community sanctions, and restorative justice measures, which reduce the need for costly incarceration.\n\n## Other Relevant European Models\n\nIn addition to the six countries examined in detail, several other European models offer valuable insights into youth justice practices:\n\n### Multifunctional Treatment in Residential and Community Settings (MultifunC)\n\nThis Scandinavian program, used in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, provides comprehensive support to high-risk youth offenders. It combines residential care with family work and community support, aiming to address the multifaceted needs of young people and facilitate their reintegration.\n\n### Secure Children's Homes (England and Wales)\n\nEngland and Wales have a network of Secure Children's Homes that provide a safe and supportive environment for vulnerable children, including those detained on welfare grounds. These facilities are smaller and more home-like than traditional youth detention centers, with a focus on individualized care and therapeutic interventions.\n\n### Youth Justice Residences (New Zealand)\n\nNew Zealand's model of youth justice residences emphasizes smaller units closer to the community, providing a supportive environment for rehabilitation and reintegration.",

    "content": "# Walking New Paths: Reflections from Bimberi\n\n![Bimberi Youth Justice Centre](/images/articles/walking-new-paths-reflections-from-bimberi-1-6a15f199.jpg)\n\nIn the quiet moments between creation and possibility, young people at Bimberi Youth Justice Centre showed us how transformation emerges through trust, creativity, and genuine opportunity. A simple observation about sneaker culture blossomed into a pathway where art meets opportunity, where designs carry dreams beyond institutional walls.\n\nCore Elements:\n\n- Walking Alongside: Mentorship through lived experience, with Jakye bringing authenticity and understanding to every conversation\n- Creative Expression: Two days of intensive design work, where blank shoes became canvases for future possibilities\n- Holistic Support: Integration with Confit Pathways' physical training, building strength in body and spirit\n- Real Pathways Forward: Partnership with Butter Sydney creating legitimate opportunities for young people's creativity\n\n### Express interest in buying some shoes\n\n![Shoes Design](/images/articles/walking-new-paths-reflections-from-bimberi-2-a4fabe63.jpeg)\n\nI landed in Canberra at midnight from Brisbane, finding the hotel key Nic had thoughtfully tucked into a magazine. The lateness of the hour and the quiet of an unfamiliar city gave me space to reflect on what lay ahead - a program born from careful listening and patient relationship building.\n\nOur journey to this moment began months earlier, walking through Bimberi with Professor Lorana Bartels. Casual conversations with young people revealed glimpses of their worlds. Outside their units sat carefully arranged sneakers, earned through the centre's points system. When one young person spoke about wanting to design his own shoes, the energy in his voice carried a spark of possibility that stayed with us.\n\nThat spark found fuel through Manoli at Butter in Sydney. His immediate understanding of the vision and generous donation of shoes and materials showed how the right connections can transform possibilities into reality. The store's commitment to displaying these designs alongside established artists offered something beyond a program - a bridge to real opportunities.\n\nOne of the most powerful elements of this program emerged from a connection built through earlier work in Canberra's justice system. During a pilot program with the Drug and Alcohol Sentencing Court (DASL), I met Jakye, whose story of transformation has become a beacon of possibility in the ACT justice landscape. Having spent much of his childhood in detention centers across Canberra and NSW, Jakye found his turning point through the DASL program. I watched him speak with quiet power at the Children's Commissioner's Report launch, his words carrying the weight of lived understanding. Now, after contributing to the latest review of Bimberi, he chose to return - not as a resident, but as a mentor and guide.\n\n![Jakye's Mentorship](/images/articles/walking-new-paths-reflections-from-bimberi-3-4ac8eb32.jpeg)\n\nOur first day opened with nervous energy from all sides. Jakye's presence brought immediate authenticity to our work. When young people tested our intentions, asking if we would really follow through, his quiet \"I know\" carried the depth of someone who had walked their path. His ability to sit with young people, sharing stories and insights born from experience, created spaces for conversations that textbooks and training could never replicate.\n\nWe moved through three separate groups, respecting the centre's mixing restrictions. Each session began with our activity from Ecuador - exploring what we Have, who we Are, and what we Can do. The depth of sharing surprised us all. Young people opened up about their dreams, their struggles, their hopes for something different. One guard's observation about a young person he'd known for years - \"I've never heard you talk about getting better as a person\" - showed how new spaces can create new conversations.\n\nBetween our first and second days, Joe and the Confit Pathways team brought their transformative energy to the centre. Watching these mentors, many with their own experience of the justice system, guide young people through physical challenges while embedding their G-Code principles - Gratitude, Grounding, and Goals - added another layer of connection. Nic joined their session, emerging tired but inspired by how physical discipline could build mental strength.\n\nWhen we returned for our second day, the energy had shifted. Young people arrived ready to transform blank shoes into personal statements. Despite never having painted shoes before, they approached the challenge with remarkable confidence. Each design emerged distinctly personal - some telling stories of culture, others of family, all carrying dreams of what could be. As we wound down our second day, the connection between our initial storytelling and the final designs became clear. Young people who had opened up about their families wove symbols of connection into their work. Those who spoke of cultural pride brought those elements forward in bold patterns and meaningful colours. Dreams shared in our first session about future possibilities emerged through design choices that spoke to ambition and hope.\n\nAs the second day unfolded, we witnessed designs emerge that carried deep emotional weight. The young people worked with quiet focus, each brush stroke seemingly connected to thoughts of life beyond these walls. Their designs spoke to possibility - some through bold colours that demanded to be seen, others through subtle patterns that revealed more with each viewing.\n\n![Designs in Progress](/images/articles/walking-new-paths-reflections-from-bimberi-4-c8ee4bb0.jpeg)\n\n![Finished Designs](/images/articles/walking-new-paths-reflections-from-bimberi-5-cada0877.jpeg)\n\n![Shoes at Bus Stop](/images/articles/walking-new-paths-reflections-from-bimberi-6-f0e12925.jpeg)\n\nThe conversations while they worked flowed between pride in their emerging skills and careful questions about what might happen next. When we talked about their designs being displayed at Butter, about setting their own prices, about money waiting for them upon release, you could feel the shift in the room. These weren't abstract promises but tangible possibilities they could hold onto.\n\nSome worked methodically, planning each element. Others let their designs flow organically, responding to the moment. But each shoe carried something of its creator's spirit - their hopes, their understanding of what waits for them outside, their belief that perhaps this time, effort poured into creation could build something new.\n\nOn our final day, I arranged their finished shoes near the bus stop - the place where they'll one day step back into freedom. Each pair spoke of creativity poured into possibility, of stories waiting to be told, of futures waiting to unfold. Some will leave to loved ones waiting with open arms, others to more uncertain welcomes. But each will leave knowing they've created something valuable, with money from their designs waiting to help them build their next chapter.\n\nWe drove away carrying a weight of responsibility. The young people's excitement about selling their shoes was tinged with the cautious hope of those who've learned hard lessons about trust. Their experiences with adults who've let them down hover in the spaces between their dreams and their doubts.\n\nThe photographs of those shoes lined up at the bus stop will stay with me - a reminder of promises made and trust given. Our words about the sales coming back to them carry the weight of their hopes. Through their designs, they've shown what becomes possible when given space to pour themselves into creation. Our task now is to honor that trust, to prove that effort poured into creativity can build bridges to life beyond these walls.\n\nIn a time when youth justice conversations often lean toward punishment over possibility, these young people have shared a different vision. Through their designs, through their willingness to trust once more, they remind us that transformation begins with simple acts of faith - in creativity, in community, and in the power of walking new paths together.\n\n### Express interest in buying some shoes\n\n![Final Design](/images/articles/walking-new-paths-reflections-from-bimberi-7-1551313f.jpeg)\n\n![Another Design](/images/articles/walking-new-paths-reflections-from-bimberi-8-21f2ed77.jpeg)\n\n![Shoes Ready for Display](/images/articles/walking-new-paths-reflections-from-bimberi-9-a738e241.jpeg)\n",

    "content": "# ReSOLEution at Bimberi Youth Justice Centre\n\nReSOLEution turns young people in detention from sneaker consumers into sneaker creators. After noticing how shoes were a source of pride and identity for youth at Bimberi, we're launching a program where they'll design and customise their own sneakers.\n\n## Key Elements:\n\n- Two intensive days of creative workshops\n- Led by mentors with lived experience of detention\n- Designs will be showcased at Butter (Sydney's sneaker culture hub)\n- Partners with Confit Pathways' fitness program\n- Creates legitimate pathways to income and community\n\n**Why It Matters:** Young people get to tell their stories, build practical skills, and connect with real commercial opportunities – all through the power of sneaker culture. It's not just about making cool shoes; it's about creating pathways out of the justice system.\n\n**Bottom Line:** Using sneakers as a canvas for change, connecting creativity to real opportunities, and showing young people they can be more than their current circumstances.\n\n## Full Article\n\nSometimes the most powerful innovations come from simply paying attention to what's already there. In my visits to Bimberi Youth Justice Centre, I noticed something striking – amid all the restrictions and uniformity, shoes were a constant source of pride and identity for the young people. They'd proudly show off their sneakers outside their units, sharing stories and connections through their footwear. It was a small but powerful reminder of their individuality and their connection to life beyond the centre's walls.\n\nThis observation didn't come in isolation. It grew from years of building relationships and understanding in Canberra's justice space, starting with a Snow Foundation-supported pilot exploring digital tools for the Drug and Alcohol Court (DASL). That experience taught me invaluable lessons about building authentic relationships and creating programs that truly reflect community needs.\n\nThrough this work, I connected with researcher Lorana Bartels, who has become an incredible force for positive change in the justice space. Her support and insights have been instrumental in shaping how we approach innovation in this sensitive and complex environment.\n\nThe ReSOLEution program emerged from this web of relationships and observations. The concept is simple but powerful: give young people the opportunity to design and create their own custom sneakers, transforming them from consumers to creators. It's not just about making cool shoes – it's about agency, creativity, and building legitimate pathways to income and recognition.\n\nWhat makes this program particularly special is the involvement of Jayke, whom I met during the DASL pilot. His lived experience of detention brings an authenticity and depth to the program that no amount of theoretical knowledge could provide. Jayke will help participants see real possibilities for changing their relationship with the system, sharing his own journey and insights.\n\nThe timing has also aligned perfectly to introduce Confit Pathways to the centre. Their program, running on alternate days to ReSOLEution, brings their powerful G-Code methodology – focusing on gratitude, grounding, and goals. This complementary approach, led by individuals with lived experience of the justice system, creates a holistic support system for the young people.\n\nWhat excites me most about this program is how it weaves together creative expression, practical skills, and genuine opportunities. When a young person designs their own shoe, they're not just creating a product – they're telling their story, developing marketable skills, and seeing a pathway to legitimate income. The pride of creation combined with the possibility of earning from their creativity could be transformative.\n\nThis project represents everything I believe about innovation in the justice system: it must be grounded in real relationships, led by lived experience, and create tangible opportunities for change. It's not about imposing solutions from outside but about amplifying and enabling the creativity and potential that's already there.\n\nAs we prepare to launch, I'm filled with both excitement and humility. This is my first full program in youth detention that I've shepherded from initial concept through to implementation. The journey here has reinforced my belief in the power of patient relationship building and the importance of really seeing and valuing what young people themselves identify as meaningful.\n\nThrough ReSOLEution and its partnership with Confit Pathways, we're not just teaching creative skills or running a program – we're trying to show young people that their creativity has value, their stories matter, and there are people who believe in their potential to create positive change in their lives.\n\nWhat makes this program particularly powerful is our partnership with Butter in Sydney. This isn't just a restaurant – it's a cultural hub for sneaker culture and custom design. Their commitment to showcasing custom sneakers and celebrating sneaker culture creates a direct line between our participants' creativity and real-world opportunities.\n\nImagine being a young person in detention, and knowing that your designs could be displayed in a venue that's at the heart of Sydney's sneaker community. It's about joining a legitimate community that exists beyond the confines of the justice system. Butter's involvement sends a powerful message: these young people's creativity has real value in the commercial world.\n\nWe're creating a bridge to a thriving community that celebrates exactly what these young people are learning to create. When they pour their stories and creativity into their designs, they're not just making something for a program – they're creating potential pathways into a legitimate community that could transform their lives.\n\nThis is why we're so excited about the Butter partnership. It completes the circle – from learning and creating, to connecting with real commercial opportunities and cultural communities. It shows our participants that if they invest in their creativity and share their stories, there are people and places ready to welcome and value their contributions.\n\nThis is just the beginning.\n\nBut it's a beginning built on solid foundations of relationships, respect, and real understanding of what matters to the young people we aim to serve. With partners like Butter, we can show these young people that their potential extends far beyond the system that currently holds them back – they truly can do anything, and we have the right connections and support to help make it happen.",

    "excerpt": "This submission addresses the urgent need for a transformative approach to youth justice in Queensland.",
    "content": "# Inquiry into the Making Queensland Safer Bill 2024 - Submission\n\nThis submission addresses the urgent need for a transformative approach to youth justice in Queensland. Recognising the limitations of the current system, this document outlines the significant opportunity presented by the upcoming legislative reforms to create a more effective, humane, and just system for young people. Drawing upon extensive research, successful models, and the voices of young people and communities, a roadmap is presented to guide the government's actions towards achieving lasting positive change.\n\n## The Opportunity for Meaningful Reform\n\nQueensland stands at a pivotal point in its approach to youth justice. The confluence of a growing demand for change, coupled with the government's commitment to introducing a new single Act for youth justice and care and protection, provides a unique opportunity to enact meaningful and lasting reform. Sources highlight the systemic failures of the existing system, characterised by high recidivism rates (between 84% and 96% of young people reoffend within 12 months of release) and the disproportionate impact on Indigenous youth. These failures demand a bold reimagining of youth justice, moving away from punitive measures towards a system that prioritises rehabilitation, reintegration, and the empowerment of young people and their communities.\n\n## A Roadmap for Change: Guiding Principles\n\nThe following principles, informed by evidence-based practices, successful models, and the lived experiences of those affected by the youth justice system, should guide the development and implementation of the new legislation and accompanying programs:\n\n- **Shifting the Focus from Punishment to Rehabilitation:** The core purpose of the youth justice system must be to rehabilitate young people, equipping them with the skills and support they need to lead fulfilling lives and become contributing members of society. This requires a fundamental shift in mindset, moving away from the notion of “adult crime, adult time” and recognising the developmental needs and potential for change inherent in young people.\n- **Embracing a Holistic Approach:** Successful rehabilitation requires addressing the complex interplay of factors that contribute to youth offending. These factors include family dysfunction, domestic and family violence, drug and alcohol use, education disengagement, mental health issues, housing instability, and poverty. A holistic approach necessitates collaboration across government departments and community organisations to provide comprehensive support that addresses the root causes of offending.\n- **Empowering Communities and Centering the Voices of Lived Experience:** Sustainable solutions must be grounded in the communities most affected by youth crime. This requires meaningful engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, ensuring their voices and knowledge are central to the design and implementation of programs. The importance of community-led solutions is exemplified by initiatives such as the Stradbroke Islander Justice Reinvestment program, which seeks to develop a community-driven strategy for improving justice outcomes for First Nations people. Similarly, the Queensland Family and Child Commission’s \"Yarning for Change\" study underscores the importance of listening to and valuing the voices of young people in contact with the youth justice system.\n- **Adopting a Developmental Approach to Crime Prevention:** Investing in early intervention and prevention is essential to reducing youth offending. This includes supporting families, creating pathways for education and employment, and providing accessible mental health and substance abuse services. By addressing risk factors early on and promoting protective factors, we can prevent young people from entering the justice system in the first place. The success of programs like Resolve, a community-based early intervention program in Logan, demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in reducing risk levels and increasing young people’s hopefulness.\n\n## Concrete Steps: A Path Forward\n\nBuilding upon these guiding principles, this submission recommends the following concrete steps to operationalise the transformative vision for youth justice in Queensland:\n\n1. **Refocusing Resources and Infrastructure:** Instead of prioritising the construction of new detention facilities, the government should redirect funds towards:\n   - Refurbishing existing youth detention centers: Upgrading facilities to create more therapeutic and rehabilitative environments.\n   - Investing in community-based programs: Expanding and replicating successful initiatives like the ReKindle Youth Justice Project in Brisbane, BG Fit's CAMPFIRE program in Mount Isa, and the Stradbroke Islander Justice Reinvestment program.\n\n2. **Adapting the Diagrama Model:** Pilot programs should be established to adapt and implement the successful Diagrama model within the Australian context. The Diagrama model, developed in Spain, has achieved low recidivism rates through its emphasis on therapeutic interventions, education and skill development, and community integration. This approach aligns with the need to shift the focus from punishment to rehabilitation, recognising the potential for change in young people.\n\n3. **Implementing a Dedicated Post-Detention Transition Program:** The current system lacks adequate support for young people transitioning back into the community. This contributes to high recidivism rates as young people often face challenges accessing housing, employment, education, and other essential services. A dedicated 12-month post-detention transition program, as recommended by the Queensland Family and Child Commission, would provide intensive, individualised support to facilitate successful reintegration. This program should incorporate in-home family interventions, facilitate effective engagement in education, training, and employment, and address the criminogenic factors in the young person’s life.\n\n4. **Establishing a Youth Justice Co-Lab:** A dedicated platform, the Youth Justice Co-Lab, should be created to foster collaboration, innovation, and knowledge sharing among stakeholders working in the youth justice sector. The Co-Lab would:\n   - Connect community organisations and amplify their voices: Supporting and scaling up successful community-led initiatives like those mentioned in the sources.\n   - Facilitate the adaptation and implementation of best practices: Exploring and adapting successful models like the Diagrama model.\n   - Advocate for evidence-based policy reform: Challenging dominant narratives and promoting a more humane and effective approach to youth justice.\n\n5. **Investing in Data Collection and Evaluation:** Robust data collection and evaluation frameworks are crucial to measure the effectiveness of implemented programs and inform continuous improvement. The government should allocate resources to track key indicators such as recidivism rates, social and emotional well-being, education and employment outcomes, and community safety. Regular evaluations, drawing upon both quantitative and qualitative data, will provide valuable insights into program impact and identify areas for improvement.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe opportunity before the Queensland Government is significant. By enacting bold reforms that prioritise rehabilitation, community empowerment, and evidence-based practices, the government can create a youth justice system that is truly just, effective, and compassionate. This roadmap, informed by the voices of young people, families, communities, and experts, provides a clear path forward for achieving lasting positive change and building a brighter future for Queensland.\n\n---\n\n## Tools and resources\n\n- [Qld Youth Justice Inquiry AI project](https://yjinquirybot.softr.app/) - https://yjinquirybot.softr.app/\n- [Justice Co-lab vision](https://www.justiceco-lab.com/about-justice-co-lab) - https://www.justiceco-lab.com/about-justice-co-lab\n- [National Youth Justice Inquiry mapping](https://www.justiceco-lab.com/justice-inquiries) - https://www.justiceco-lab.com/justice-inquiries\n- [DRAFT - Justice Mapping](https://reconnected.softr.app/justice-reinvestment) - https://reconnected.softr.app/justice-reinvestment\n\n## Key links and stories\n\n- [Breaking Bread, Breaking Chains: When Two Worlds Collide](https://www.justiceco-lab.com/article/breaking-bread-breaking-chains-when-two-worlds-collide)\n- [Spotlight on Changemaker Brodie Germaine](https://www.justiceco-lab.com/article/spotlight-on-changemaker-brodie-germaine)\n- [Connecting Communities: A Network for Justice Reinvestment](https://www.justiceco-lab.com/article/connecting-communities-a-network-for-justice-reinvestment)\n- [The Nature of Power: How Control Shapes Youth Justice](https://www.justiceco-lab.com/article/the-nature-of-power-how-control-shapes-youth-justice)\n\n## Diagrama Further Reading and Resources\n\n1. **Diagrama Foundation Overview**\n   - [Official Diagrama Foundation website](https://www.fundaciondiagrama.es/en)\n   - [A Blueprint for Change Adapting the lessons of the Spanish Youth Justice System to the Northern Territory, Report of Diagrama visit October 2019](https://ddhs.org.au/sites/default/files/media-library/documents/Blueprint%20for%20Change%20-%20Diagrama%20Foundation%20Report%20FINAL.pdf)\n\n2. **Academic Studies and Evaluations**\n   - [Perceptions and experiences of children and young people in English Custodial Centres and Spanish Re-educational Centres: A comparative study, D Romero McGuire · 2018](https://uobrep.openrepository.com/handle/10547/624044)\n   - [Various European Research led by Diagrama](https://www.fundaciondiagrama.es/en/research/europe)\n\n3. **International Youth Justice Models**\n   - [The international Juvenile Justice Observatory (IJJO) was established as a non-profit organisation in Brussels in January 2002 by Fundación Diagrama (Spain)](https://www.diagramafoundation.org.uk/international-juvenile-justice-observatory)\n\n4. **Economic Analysis**\n   - [Washington State Institute for Public Policy: \"Benefit-Cost Results for Juvenile Justice Programs\"](https://www.wsipp.wa.gov/BenefitCost?topicId=1)\n   - [The Pew Charitable Trusts: \"Re-Examining Juvenile Incarceration\"](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/04/reexamining-juvenile-incarceration)\n\n5. **Personal Accounts and Media Coverage**\n   - [7NEWS Spotlight](https://7news.com.au/spotlight/7news-spotlight-kids-and-crime-the-silver-bullet-to-tackle-australias-youth-crime-crisis-c-15017386)\n   - [BBC visits Diagrama's custodial centres in Spain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MHjnV2D31w)\n   - [Kate Bjur’s, Churchill Fellowship The Diagrama Model - Spain](https://katebjur.blogspot.com/2023/03/the-diagrama-model-spain.html)\n\n6. **Implementation Guides**\n   - [Council of Europe: \"Guidelines for a Therapeutic Approach to Juvenile Justice\"](https://www.coe.int/en/web/children/child-friendly-justice)\n",

    "content": "# Breaking Bread, Breaking Chains: When Two Worlds Collide\n\n![Breaking Bread, Breaking Chains](/images/articles/breaking-bread-breaking-chains-when-two-worlds-collide-1-5392a6eb.jpg)\n\nThe choice is ours. But remember: every day we choose fear over faith, punishment over possibility, we're not just failing our young people. We're failing our own humanity.\n\n## The Contrast: Two tables showed two systems\n\n- One outside: Young people cooking and sharing food with community\n- One virtual: Young person speaking from youth detention\n\n- **The Power Gap**:\n  - Current system built on fear and control\n  - Community approach built on connection and growth\n\n- **ReKindle's Approach**:\n  - Reject cookie-cutter government programs\n  - Build a village, not just services\n  - Focus on belonging, not just behaviour\n\n- **The Real Choice**:\n  - Fear vs. Faith in young people\n  - Walls vs. Pathways\n  - Control vs. Connection\n\n- **The Bottom Line**:\n  - Youth justice needs complete reimagining\n  - Community-led solutions work better than punishment\n  - We can't punish our way to public safety\n\nYesterday at ReKindle, we witnessed a profound illustration of Australia's youth justice paradox. Two tables existed simultaneously – one physical, one virtual – each telling a different story about power, privilege, and possibility in our society.\n\n### A Tale of Two Tables\n\nAt the first table, under open skies, young people moved with purpose, cooking traditional foods alongside mentors. Gamilaraay woman and Commissioner Natalie Lewis sat with her Queensland Family and Child Commission team, while local Uncles and Aunties watched on. The air was filled with conversation, laughter, and the aroma of shared meals.\n\nThe second table existed only through pixels and prison walls – a young person joining us virtually from Brisbane Youth Detention Centre. Their voice, clear and confident, cut through the digital divide to share truths about survival in a system designed to contain rather than nurture.\n\n![Image 1](/images/articles/breaking-bread-breaking-chains-when-two-worlds-collide-2-a2092535.jpeg)\n\n![Image 2](/images/articles/breaking-bread-breaking-chains-when-two-worlds-collide-3-559bf363.jpeg)\n\n### The Power of Contrast\n\nThis stark juxtaposition revealed something profound about how our society wields power. One space represented liberation – young people moving freely, creating, contributing, connecting with culture and community. The other space embodied control – a young person constrained by a system built on colonial foundations of surveillance and punishment.\n\nThe young person on screen spoke about reentry with a wisdom that challenged the system's narrative. They talked about distrust – not as a personal failing, but as a rational response to institutional betrayal. They described the lack of support not as an oversight, but as a feature of a system designed to maintain social order rather than foster genuine transformation.\n\n### Beyond the Prison of Privilege\n\nThe current youth justice narrative serves those furthest from its impact. Politicians campaign on promises of safety, media outlets profit from fear, and privileged voters sleep better believing that punishment equals protection. This is what philosophers call \"biopower\" – the way institutions manage and control populations through fear, policy, and prejudice.\n\nBut yesterday showed us a different kind of power. We saw:\n- Young people as creators, not criminals\n- Elders as wisdom-keepers, not bystanders\n- Community as the answer, not the problem\n\n### ReKindle's Revolution: Building a New System\n\nAt ReKindle, we're not just operating outside government funding streams – we're challenging the very epistemology of youth justice. We reject:\n- The notion that punishment leads to transformation\n- The idea that young people need to be \"managed\" rather than mentored\n- The false choice between community safety and youth empowerment\n\nInstead, we're building a village based on:\n- Indigenous ways of knowing and healing\n- Authentic relationships that acknowledge struggle and growth\n- Multiple pathways to belonging and becoming\n\n![Image 3](/images/articles/breaking-bread-breaking-chains-when-two-worlds-collide-4-83361661.jpeg)\n\n![Image 4](/images/articles/breaking-bread-breaking-chains-when-two-worlds-collide-5-cc372182.jpeg)\n\n### The Politics of Fear vs. The Power of Connection\n\nThe system maintains itself through what philosophers call \"disciplinary power\" – creating docile bodies through surveillance, punishment, and the threat of incarceration. This approach particularly targets Indigenous youth, perpetuating colonial patterns of control.\n\nYesterday showed us the alternative. When the young person from detention spoke about their fears and hopes, they weren't speaking to a system – they were speaking to a community. Commissioner Lewis's questions weren't about management strategies; they were about understanding, about seeing the whole person behind the statistics.\n\n### Reimagining Justice\n\nThe current system asks: \"How do we stop young people from offending?\"\nWe ask: \"How do we help young people belong?\"\n\nThe system invests in walls and warnings.\nWe invest in relationships and possibilities.\n\nThe system sees young people through the lens of risk.\nWe see them through the lens of potential.\n\n### A Call to Action\n\nI was once a young person pushing against authority, searching for identity in rebellion. The difference between my story and many others wasn't in the anger – it was in who was there to help channel it.\n\nThat's why yesterday mattered. While one young person spoke to us through prison walls, others were building community through the simple act of preparing and sharing food. Both scenarios show us what's at stake in how we approach youth justice:\n\n- Will we build more prisons, or more pathways?\n- Will we invest in punishment, or possibility?\n- Will we choose fear, or will we choose faith in our young people?\n\n![Image 5](/images/articles/breaking-bread-breaking-chains-when-two-worlds-collide-6-e811e06f.jpeg)\n\n![Image 6](/images/articles/breaking-bread-breaking-chains-when-two-worlds-collide-7-f5d4cb4f.jpeg)\n\n### The Path Forward\n\nThe answer isn't in white papers or election promises. It was visible yesterday in:\n- The pride in young people's eyes as they served food they'd prepared\n- The wisdom in Elders' presence and support\n- The courage of a young person speaking truth from behind walls\n- The commitment of community leaders willing to listen and learn\n\nWe stand at a crossroads in youth justice. One path leads to more surveillance, more punishment, more fear. The other leads to what we witnessed yesterday – community, connection, and the possibility of genuine transformation.\n\nThe choice is ours. But remember: every day we choose fear over faith, punishment over possibility, we're not just failing our young people. We're failing our own humanity.\n\n---\n\n*Written in reflection after a profound gathering at ReKindle, where the simple act of sharing food became a powerful metaphor for the choice between punishment and possibility in youth justice.*",

    "content": "# Spotlight on Brodie Germaine: A Catalyst for Youth Empowerment through Cultural Connection and Wellness\n\nIn the world of youth justice and community transformation, Brodie Germaine is making a substantial impact. As the founder of *BG Fit* and the visionary behind initiatives like the CAMPFIRE Project and BAIL (Be an Indigenous Leader), Brodie is harnessing the power of cultural immersion, fitness, and personal mentorship to foster resilience and empower Indigenous youth in Queensland. Here's a closer look at his work and how his unique approach is shaping lives.\n\n### CAMPFIRE Project: Embracing Culture and Resilience\n\nThe CAMPFIRE Project is more than just an intervention—it’s a holistic, community-led program that prioritizes cultural connection, ancestral wisdom, and personal growth. Rooted in the experiences and guidance of Indigenous Elders, the project provides young people in the child protection system with essential tools for resilience and identity-building. Through *Camping on Country* trips, mentorship, and regular fitness activities, CAMPFIRE creates a supportive, trauma-informed environment where young people can reconnect with their roots, gain a sense of belonging, and build self-confidence.\n\nKey objectives of CAMPFIRE include:\n\n- Reconnecting youth with cultural identity and heritage.\n- Offering a space for open dialogue through yarning circles.\n- Providing access to mentors and role models who guide youth in their personal and cultural journeys.\n\nBy focusing on cultural grounding and resilience, Brodie aims to foster long-term positive changes, empowering young people to become leaders in their communities.\n\n![CAMPFIRE Project Image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6541df32dc229bb7babac598/671feca3853482b5849adc70_66fb01672be175462d2451f2_Confit_Mount_Isa_Day_1_Morning%2520(59%2520of%252064).jpeg)\n\n### BAIL Project: Empowering Indigenous Youth as Leaders\n\nBrodie’s work goes beyond traditional fitness; with the *BAIL (Be an Indigenous Leader)* Project, he combines physical wellness with cultural teachings to offer youth a path away from crime and towards leadership. This initiative focuses on delivering fitness programs that incorporate sports like touch football and culturally significant activities such as fishing and yarning circles. Engaging young people between the ages of 12 and 17, BAIL aims to:\n\n- Provide a constructive alternative to crime.\n- Strengthen physical and mental health through exercise.\n- Foster connections with culture and community.\n\nWith a target to impact at least 100 young people each year, BAIL addresses social issues that often lead youth astray, such as a lack of engagement in education and limited community support. Brodie’s goal is to provide a sustainable support system, reducing reoffending rates and promoting school and career engagement.\n\n![BAIL Project Image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6541df32dc229bb7babac598/66fb0347ca7e5bc6614e108c_66fb015f172cf15b1decab7f_Confit_Mount_Isa_Day_1_Morning%2520(39%2520of%252064).jpeg)\n\n### Brodie's Vision: Creating a Community Wellness Hub\n\nBeyond these projects, Brodie has a vision for a comprehensive wellness center—one that integrates fitness, cultural education, and community support. This hub will provide a safe, inclusive space for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to improve their physical, mental, and emotional health. The wellness center would be a place of empowerment, offering programs that:\n\n- Support physical health with diverse fitness activities.\n- Deepen cultural connections through traditional practices.\n- Promote mental well-being through community-building activities.\n\nThis centre embodies Brodie’s commitment to his community. He envisions it as a space where people can come together, share experiences, and find strength in collective identity and wellness.\n\n### Supporting Brodie's Mission\n\nBrodie’s dedication to his community is evident in every initiative he leads. His story is a testament to resilience, cultural pride, and the transformative power of wellness. By uplifting and supporting Indigenous youth, he’s fostering a new generation of leaders who carry forward their heritage with pride.\n\nAs Brodie Germaine continues to expand his impact, there are numerous ways to support his mission. Connecting him with resources, collaborating with his initiatives, or simply sharing his story can go a long way in empowering him to scale his work. For anyone interested in supporting Indigenous-led, community-driven programs, Brodie’s work with BG Fit, CAMPFIRE, and BAIL offers a powerful example of what’s possible when culture, wellness, and mentorship come together.\n\n*Learn more about Brodie’s work at BG Fit and his ongoing projects to empower Indigenous youth. Together, we can uplift his vision and create pathways for young people to thrive, connect with their heritage, and lead empowered lives.*",

    "content": "# Community at the Core: Empowering Local Solutions in Youth Justice\n\n![Community at the Core](/images/articles/community-at-the-core-empowering-local-solutions-in-youth-justice-1-cc21348d.jpg)\n\nThis blog explores how community-led approaches and Indigenous-led solutions provide more effective and long-lasting alternatives to the punitive measures currently driving youth justice policy.\n\n## Introduction: The Role of Community in Youth Justice\n\nIn Australia, the youth justice system is at a critical crossroads. While government initiatives have historically focused on punitive approaches, recent policies have not only stalled progress on reducing Indigenous youth incarceration—they have, in some cases, actively reversed it. However, the solutions for genuine change don’t lie in harsher punishments or expanding detention centres. Instead, they exist within the **communities** most affected by these issues.\n\nThe time has come to reframe how we approach youth justice, putting **community-driven solutions** at the core of reform. Indigenous-led initiatives, justice reinvestment, and cultural connections are showing far better results than punitive measures. These models not only address the root causes of youth crime but also foster long-term healing and empowerment.\n\n## Government Policy Reversals: The Setback in Youth Justice\n\nDespite the rhetoric of **closing the gap**, many government policies have taken backward steps when it comes to youth justice reform. For example, the **lowering of the age of criminal responsibility** and reversals on bail laws in Queensland and other regions have worsened the situation. Indigenous youth, already over-represented in the justice system, are being incarcerated at alarming rates, and these policies are directly contributing to that increase.\n\nReports from the **Productivity Commission** and other bodies highlight this growing gap between **government promises** and **real outcomes**. While some states had made tentative steps toward raising the age of criminal responsibility and reducing Indigenous incarceration rates, recent actions have undone much of that progress. This reflects a failure to listen to the voices of Indigenous leaders and communities who have long called for reforms based on cultural healing and community engagement.\n\n![Government Policy Reversals](/images/articles/community-at-the-core-empowering-local-solutions-in-youth-justice-2-4da62f9d.jpeg)\n\n## The Success of Community-Led Approaches\n\nWhile government policies stumble, **community-driven approaches** are demonstrating real success. **Justice reinvestment**, for example, focuses on redirecting funds from prisons and detention centres toward **community programs** that address the underlying causes of youth crime—like poverty, trauma, and lack of educational opportunities.\n\nA key example is the **Maranguka Justice Reinvestment Project** in Bourke, New South Wales. Through partnerships with local leaders and Indigenous communities, this initiative has shown a significant drop in youth crime, with fewer young people entering the justice system. What makes justice reinvestment effective is its **holistic approach**: it sees young people not as offenders to be punished, but as community members to be supported. Programs focus on **healing trauma, building skills, and strengthening cultural connections**, all of which reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nInstead of locking young people away, these programs offer pathways back into the community. By investing in **education, mentorship, and cultural programs**, justice reinvestment helps prevent youth from entering the system in the first place.\n\n## Indigenous-Led Solutions: The Power of Cultural Connection\n\nAt the heart of successful community-driven approaches are **Indigenous-led solutions**, which emphasise **cultural knowledge, storytelling, and kinship support**. These approaches are based on principles that have guided Indigenous communities for generations: that **healing** is more powerful than punishment, and that young people thrive when they are connected to their culture, identity, and community.\n\nPrograms led by Indigenous Elders and local leaders focus on **reconnecting young people to their heritage**, providing mentorship, and fostering a sense of belonging. This connection to culture serves as a powerful tool in breaking the cycles of trauma and crime that many Indigenous youth face.\n\nThe idea is simple: when young people feel seen, heard, and understood within the context of their culture, they are more likely to engage positively with their communities and avoid the justice system. By empowering Indigenous leaders to take the reins on youth justice programs, we not only honour their deep cultural wisdom but also create solutions that are **sustainable, community-centred, and effective**.\n\n## Why Community-Led Solutions Are the Future of Youth Justice\n\nThe evidence is clear: **community-led solutions work**. Programs that focus on **restorative justice, cultural healing, and empowerment** show far better long-term outcomes than punitive measures like incarceration. But for these programs to continue making a difference, they need **consistent support and investment**—and this is where governments must change their approach.\n\nInstead of doubling down on policies that **entrench disadvantage** and increase incarceration rates, governments should focus on **scaling up community-based initiatives**. The Queensland government's recent $50 million investment in finding the world’s best youth crime solutions presents a unique opportunity to do just that. By working with local leaders, Indigenous thinkers, and successful programs like those developed by the **Diagrama Foundation**, we can create a youth justice system that focuses on **healing, not punishment**.\n\n## Conclusion: Empowering Communities to Lead the Way\n\nYouth justice in Australia needs a fundamental shift away from punishment and toward **community empowerment**. **Government reversals** in youth justice policy are actively harming the progress that was made toward reducing Indigenous incarceration. But the solutions are already here—in the wisdom of Indigenous communities and in the success of programs like **justice reinvestment**.\n\nBy centring **community-led approaches** and investing in **Indigenous-led solutions**, we can begin to reverse the cycle of harm that has affected so many young people. This is the future of youth justice: one that is **driven by local knowledge, grounded in cultural connection**, and focused on creating pathways to healing and success for the next generation.\n\n![Empowering Communities](/images/articles/community-at-the-core-empowering-local-solutions-in-youth-justice-3-f689074e.jpeg)\n\n‍",

    "content": "# The Nature of Power: How Control Shapes Youth Justice\n\n![The Nature of Power](/images/articles/the-nature-of-power-how-control-shapes-youth-justice-1-f4c81925.jpg)\n\nPower shapes the very core of our justice system, particularly when it comes to youth justice.\n\n## The Concentration of Power in Youth Justice\n\nPower in youth justice is concentrated in the hands of **governments and large organisations**. These entities design policies, control resources, and shape how society views youth crime. They hold the keys to deciding whether the system leans toward punishment or rehabilitation.\n\nBut what drives them to consistently choose punitive approaches?\n\nThe answer lies in **political incentives**. Governments, especially during election cycles, are under pressure to appear \"tough on crime.\" Harsh policies—like increased policing and stricter sentencing—are quick, visible solutions that resonate with the public’s fears. Youth crime becomes a **symbol of broader social instability**, and taking a \"strong\" stance seems like the easiest way to reassure voters that order is being restored.\n\nHowever, these **punitive measures** rarely address the **underlying causes** of youth crime—poverty, trauma, lack of education, and systemic disadvantage. The focus on punishment continues because it’s politically convenient, not because it works.\n\n## The Role of Fear and Public Perception\n\nWhy does the \"tough-on-crime\" rhetoric work so well with voters?\n\nFear is a powerful tool. When youth crime is framed as a direct threat to public safety, many citizens, especially those far removed from the realities of marginalised communities, see punitive approaches as necessary. It’s a **simplified narrative**: harsher sentences and more police mean safer streets.\n\nBut there’s more at play. **Privilege** shapes how the public perceives youth crime. Those in positions of privilege—whether due to race, class, or geography—often don’t experience the same social conditions that lead to offending. As a result, they support policies that target marginalised youth, particularly Indigenous youth, because they don’t see the **root causes** of crime—just the outcomes that make them feel unsafe.\n\nThe media amplifies these fears by portraying young offenders as **faceless threats**. This narrative dehumanises them, stripping away the complex social, economic, and cultural factors that shape their behaviour It becomes easier to justify punishment when you don't see the full picture.\n\n## A Legacy of Colonialism\n\nThe over-representation of Indigenous youth in Australia’s justice system is no coincidence. It is the product of a **colonial history** where laws were used to control and marginalise Indigenous populations. The system was designed to protect those in power, while simultaneously subjugating others.\n\nThis legacy continues today. The justice system is still primarily focused on **control and punishment**, rather than healing or addressing the root causes of youth crime, such as **intergenerational trauma** and **systemic inequality**. The punitive system reflects a colonial framework that doesn’t align with the broader ethical values of fairness and equality but instead perpetuates cycles of harm for Indigenous communities.\n\n## Rethinking the Purpose of Justice\n\nTo truly question the power dynamics at play, we need to ask: **What is the true purpose of justice?** If it’s only about punishment, then the system may seem to work as intended. But if justice is about creating a safer, fairer society, then it’s clear that the system is failing.\n\nWe need to return to **first principles**. Justice should be about **rehabilitation, healing, and restoring relationships**. Punitive measures don’t achieve this—they exacerbate harm, particularly for marginalised communities. Governments continue to favour punitive approaches because it’s **easier to demonstrate control**—but this control is an illusion. The real safety and stability we seek won’t come from incarceration but from **addressing the social conditions** that lead to crime in the first place.\n\n## Challenging Systemic Power Imbalances\n\nCommunity-based solutions, especially those led by Indigenous leaders and people with lived experience, challenge the dominance of centralised power. These approaches are often marginalised in the policy discourse because they require a **redistribution of resources and decision-making authority**—away from large institutions and towards local communities.\n\nGovernments and large organisations are reluctant to relinquish this control, even though **community-driven solutions** have been proven to reduce reoffending and create long-term, sustainable change. If power were redistributed to those most impacted by youth crime, we’d likely see a justice system that’s more **responsive to local needs** and **focused on healing** rather than punishment.\n\n## Conclusion: Power, Privilege, and Political Incentives\n\nBy looking at youth justice through the lens of power dynamics, we see that the system is shaped not by what works, but by what’s politically convenient. The **tough-on-crime rhetoric** continues to appeal to voters because it aligns with fear, privilege, and the desire for simple solutions to complex problems. But real justice requires a shift in power—toward communities, Indigenous leaders, and people with lived experience—so that we can build a system that heals, empowers, and restores.\n\nIn the next post, we’ll explore how **community-driven solutions** could offer an alternative to the punitive system—and why storytelling is key to sharing these solutions.\n\n## Next in the Series:\n\nStay tuned for part two, where we’ll discuss **community-driven approaches to youth justice**, and how these solutions provide more effective, long-term results than punishment ever could. We’ll also delve into the importance of **storytelling** as a tool for amplifying local successes.\n\n![Gallery Image](/images/articles/the-nature-of-power-how-control-shapes-youth-justice-2-d4b9ff5c.jpg)",

    "content": "# From Punishment to Potential: Lessons from Spain's Innovative Youth Justice Model - Day 1 with Diagrama\n\nSpain's Diagrama youth detention centers reveals a transformative approach to juvenile justice that prioritises rehabilitation, positive relationships, and hope for a better future.\n\n## Day 1 Reflection: A Visit to Diagrama's Youth Detention Center in Spain\n\nAs I stepped into the Diagrama youth detention centere in Spain, I felt like I was entering a different world. Far from the punitive institutions I'm accustomed to, this place felt more like a supportive holiday camp. Diagrama, a non-profit organisation that has been working with young offenders since 1991, has developed a unique approach to rehabilitating disadvantaged youth over the past three decades.\n\nThe welcoming atmosphere was evident from the start. A friendly staff member greeted us at the gate, which was secured by a modest fence that seemed more symbolic than imposing. We entered with our cameras and phones, guided only by the respectful request not to capture the young people's faces. Inside, the staff wore casual civilian clothes, fostering a sense of normalcy and connection.\n\nOver coffee and delectable biscuits, we discussed the lives of the young people in Diagrama's care. The centre we visited was one of over 35 that Diagrama operates across Spain, ranging from small 12-bed facilities to larger 70-100 bed centres. They work with boys and girls aged 14-23, many of whom have been convicted of violent offences and face complex challenges such as disengagement from education, family issues, health problems, learning difficulties, substance abuse, and mental health conditions.\n\n![Diagrama Center](/images/articles/from-punishment-to-potential-lessons-from-spains-innovative-youth-justice-model---day-1-with-diagrama-2-24907f21.jpg)\n\n![Diagrama Center](/images/articles/from-punishment-to-potential-lessons-from-spains-innovative-youth-justice-model---day-1-with-diagrama-1-c55fb2c2.jpg)\n\nDespite these challenges, the staff's commitment to holding high expectations for every youth was palpable. They support each individual's progress towards education, employment, and overall well-being, adapting their approach to the local culture and needs of the diverse regions where they operate. This tailored approach, combined with earned privileges like family visits and community trips, fosters a sense of motivation and purpose.\n\nAs we toured the facility, I was struck by the absence of adults simply standing guard. Instead, staff members were actively engaged with the young people - teaching, playing sports, working together in the workshop. The conversations flowed naturally, filled with the usual teenage banter and laughter. It was a testament to the positive relationships at the heart of Diagrama's model.\n\nIn a classroom, we spent half an hour with a group of students learning math. They were curious about the lives of detained youth in Australia, and as I described the long hours spent alone in rooms, the regimented lines, constant metal detector scans, institutional clothing, and the pervasive sense of distrust, I could feel their unease. The contrast was stark.\n\n![Classroom](/images/articles/from-punishment-to-potential-lessons-from-spains-innovative-youth-justice-model---day-1-with-diagrama-3-4bd0f399.jpeg)\n\n![Diagrama Center](/images/articles/from-punishment-to-potential-lessons-from-spains-innovative-youth-justice-model---day-1-with-diagrama-4-68c91d3d.jpg)\n\nDiagrama's impressive track record speaks for itself. Since 1991, they have supported over 40,000 young people in detention. A 2019 study found that only 13.6% of youth released from their centers in the Murcia region returned to custody over a 6-year period, a recidivism rate far lower than typical. This success is rooted in their ability to maintain a safe, stable environment through positive relationships, with minimal need for restraint or force. In 2018, less than 10% of youth were restrained, and under 7% committed a serious incident after their first two months.\n\nOver lunch, I met a young man whose English was impeccable. We talked about his love of literature, his aspirations to work for the UN, his travel dreams, and his plans to pursue studies once released. This was no special occasion - just a typical meal where staff and youth sit together, sharing food and conversation. This young man, despite his past offence, now has a path forward filled with opportunities, thanks to the support and guidance he's received at Diagrama.\n\n![Lunch](/images/articles/from-punishment-to-potential-lessons-from-spains-innovative-youth-justice-model---day-1-with-diagrama-5-4d3f1579.jpg)\n\n![Lunch](/images/articles/from-punishment-to-potential-lessons-from-spains-innovative-youth-justice-model---day-1-with-diagrama-6-b4826fd7.jpg)\n\nAs a father of young girls who could one day face the juvenile justice system, I find myself yearning to bring Diagrama's approach to Australia. With only around 800 youth in detention at any given time, we have a real chance to pilot a new model of care - one that has earned Diagrama international recognition, including special consultative status with the United Nations.\n\nBringing this vision to life will require community education and support. It means shifting the narrative from punishment to rehabilitation and investing in the potential of young people who have stumbled. But the stakes are too high to ignore the opportunity. I leave Diagrama feeling inspired and determined to dedicate myself to this cause, knowing that every young person deserves a chance to thrive. With Diagrama's expertise as a guide, I believe we can transform youth justice in Australia and beyond.\n\nLearn more about Diagrama here - [Diagrama Foundation](https://www.fundaciondiagrama.es/en)",

    "content": "# The Road to Hell: When Youth Justice Efforts Backfire\n\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions, as the saying goes. This rings particularly true when it comes to youth justice policies and interventions aimed at curbing juvenile crime. All too often, well-meaning efforts to \"get tough\" on youth offenders or provide rehabilitative services end up doing more harm than good – a phenomenon known as iatrogenics.\n\nIatrogenics refers to when an intervention, treatment or policy causes unintended harm or negative consequences that outweigh any potential benefits. The term is derived from the Greek iatros, meaning \"healer\" or \"physician\", highlighting how even those with the best of intentions can inadvertently make a situation worse.\n\nThis appears to be playing out in the youth justice crisis currently gripping Queensland. In a reactionary bid to crack down on youth crime, the state government has introduced a raft of harsh measures, including:\n\n- Allowing children as young as 10 to be detained in adult police watch houses\n- Suspending the state's Human Rights Act to enable this practice\n- Expanding the youth detention centre network from 3 to 5 sites\n\nThese \"tough on crime\" policies fly in the face of overwhelming evidence that detaining children, especially in adult facilities, is profoundly damaging and increases the likelihood of future offending.\n\nBy pursuing a punitive approach focused on incarceration rather than addressing root causes, the Queensland government risks inflicting serious iatrogenic harm.\n\n![Child Prison](/images/articles/the-road-to-hell-when-youth-justice-efforts-backfire-1-dbe3528f.png)\n\n![Child Park](/images/articles/the-road-to-hell-when-youth-justice-efforts-backfire-2-8e740a2b.png)\n\n## The Media's Role\n\nPart of the problem lies in how youth crime narratives are being shaped and amplified by sensationalistic media coverage. As the research shows, regular negative stereotyping and disproportionate focus on youth offending can be profoundly alienating for young people.\n\nIt creates a vicious cycle of stigmatisation, alienation and anti-social behaviour. The media frequently fails to provide nuance or context around complex social issues that contribute to youth offending, such as poverty, trauma, mental illness and lack of community support services.\n\nInstead, the narrative becomes one of moral panic demanding harsh crackdowns on a perceived \"youth crime wave.\" This plays right into the hands of political opportunists seeking tough-on-crime bona fides, regardless of whether their policies are evidence-based or likely to be effective in the long run. As long as the media drives this punitive narrative, it becomes easier for governments to pursue iatrogenic interventions that may be politically popular but ultimately make things worse.\n\n![Man Prison](/images/articles/the-road-to-hell-when-youth-justice-efforts-backfire-3-c1d7873f.png)\n\n![Man Park](/images/articles/the-road-to-hell-when-youth-justice-efforts-backfire-4-02bce5b4.png)\n\n## An Evidence-Based Approach\n\nThe better path forward, as highlighted by numerous experts and human rights bodies, is to prioritise preventative, rehabilitative and diversionary approaches aimed at addressing root causes and keeping kids out of the criminal justice system wherever possible.\n\nThis could include:\n\n- Investing in community-based early intervention and family support services\n- Improving access to education, mental health care, addiction treatment and disability services\n- Funding innovative on-country cultural programs and mentorship initiatives\n- Raising the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to at least 14, in line with medical consensus on childhood brain development\n\nUltimately, we must resist the urge for quick-fix \"solutions\" driven by moral panic and political pointscoring. When it comes to complex social issues like youth crime, naive interventionism often does more harm than good in the long run. By taking an evidence-based, preventative approach focused on addressing root causes, we have a much better chance of improving community safety while protecting the rights and wellbeing of vulnerable young people.\n\nThe alternative is to keep traveling further down the road of iatrogenic policies - a road that is indeed paved with good intentions, but ultimately leads to a hell of unintended consequences.",

Yet, this portrayal misses a fundamental truth about the nature of our world and our society: disorder is not a mistake; it is the default. Order is always artificial and temporary. As we navigate the complexities of youth justice, we find ourselves at a crossroads between continuing on a path of punitive measures and seeking innovative ways to support young individuals towards a brighter future. This blog post aims to explore the concept of entropy as it relates to youth justice, urging a shift in focus towards solutions that embrace support, rehabilitation, and hope.\n\n### The Misalignment and Its Implications\n\nBy framing youth offending as a 'crisis' and relying on punitive measures, we contribute to the entropy, creating a system that is increasingly difficult to navigate and reform. The analogy of stirring jam into rice pudding, as Tom Stoppard eloquently described, illustrates the irreversible nature of introducing disorder; once present, it cannot be undone by simply reversing our actions. Thus, the conventional approach to youth justice, focusing on containment and punishment, fails to address the root causes of youth crime and only adds to the systemic chaos.\n\n### Innovating Against the Tide of Entropy\n\nCountering the entropic drift in youth justice requires the infusion of new, innovative energy. We must reconceptualise our approach to youth crime, not as a problem to be suppressed but as an opportunity for meaningful intervention and support. Programs emphasising community engagement, education, skill development, and mental health support represent a way forward, offering a chance to reduce disorder by equipping young people with the necessary tools and support to face their challenges constructively.\n\n### Creating Order from Chaos\n\nManaging entropy in the youth justice system demands an active investment in solutions that promote resilience, understanding, and growth. This calls for a collective effort that includes government, law enforcement, communities, families, educators, and the young people themselves. Shifting our focus from punitive measures to support and rehabilitation can transform the youth justice system into one that not only mitigates recidivism but also empowers young individuals to make positive societal contributions.\n\n### Embracing the Complexity\n\nThe lesson of entropy teaches us that while disorder is inevitable, it can be managed and even harnessed for positive outcomes. The complexity of youth justice issues demands nuanced, multifaceted solutions. By embracing this complexity and prioritising innovative, supportive measures, we can begin to alleviate the disorder and pave the way for a future where young people are empowered to succeed.\n\nIn conclusion, the entropic nature of our youth justice system requires a paradigm shift towards supportive, rehabilitative measures. By understanding and applying the principles of entropy, we can foster a more positive, hopeful future for young individuals, steering them away from chaos and towards a path of opportunity and growth.\n\n![Author Benjamin Knight](/images/articles/the-paradox-of-youth-justice-and-entropy-navigating-the-chaos-towards-hope-2-e00356dc.jpg)\n\n**Benjamin Knight**\n\nCurious.

Raised by a single mother, a Korean international student, Joe's childhood was marked by instability, frequent relocations, and a struggle with English and financial difficulties. School provided no solace for young Joe, where he felt outcast and misunderstood. His disruptive behaviour, a cry for attention, led to multiple expulsions, driving him further towards the streets and away from the educational system.\n\n> “I was known as the angry kid...even the smallest things used to tick me off. I’d always get into fights. That’s how I got the attention of the local street gang.”\n\nIn these streets, Joe found a sense of belonging and respect that was absent at home and school. The local gang, despite its criminal activities, offered him a familial bond, with crime being a secondary element to the brotherhood he experienced.\n\n![The early days of gang life](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-2-f8d0ea22.jpeg)\n\n## The Underworld's Lure: Rise and Fall\n\nAs Joe grew older, his role in the gang evolved from minor drug pick-ups to running his own criminal syndicate by age 21. Despite being aware of other life paths, he felt they were beyond his reach, his belief in his life's inevitability shaped by his environment and the lack of a supportive network.\n\n> “It wasn’t the crime that actually got me. It was more that belonging, and crime was always that by-factor of wanting to belong to a community because I never felt accepted at school, but I was always feeling accepted in that gang culture.”\n\nJoe's descent into the criminal underworld was swift and dramatic. His life became a cycle of illicit dealings, primarily with drugs like MDMA, providing him a distorted sense of security and identity. However, this life built on a foundation of risk and treachery led to his dramatic arrest, marking the end of one chapter and the onset of his transformative journey in prison.\n\n![Not long before the downfall](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-3-bdde51f3.jpeg)\n\n![High flying](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-4-35ef3cfa.jpeg)\n\n## Echoes of Confinement: Life Behind Bars\n\nIn the monotonous confines of prison, Joe's life, once vibrant with the unpredictable pulse of the streets, was reduced to a slow, unyielding passage of time. The walls of his cell, cold and indifferent, were a stark contrast to the freedom he had known. Yet, in this place of desolation, a path to redemption began to unfold, marking the start of an incredible transformation.\n\n> \"In the beginning, everything in jail was a shock – the violence, the noise, the desperation. But over time, you start to adapt, you start to find ways to cope. For me, it was about realising that even in this chaos, I could choose my path, stay clear of trouble, and focus on something positive.\"\n\n![Still inside](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-5-d02041aa.jpeg)\n\n## The Mentor in the Shadows: A New Dawn\n\nJoe's time in prison became a catalyst for change, largely due to an unexpected mentorship. He met a man, a 'billionaire accountant,' serving time for tax fraud. This individual, unlike anyone Joe had ever met, introduced him to new ways of thinking about education, self-worth, and business. Their shared cell turned into an impromptu classroom, where discussions and books replaced the bars and chains. Joe's perspective on life began to shift. He says, \"Meeting my cellmate, the 'billionaire accountant,' opened a new world for me. He challenged me to think beyond the prison walls, to see education and self-improvement as my way out. That's when I knew my life had to change, and I started working towards a future I never thought possible.\" This encounter led Joe to pursue his high school education in prison, culminating in his acceptance into the University of New South Wales and paving the way for the inception of ConFit.\n\n![A happy day and a new life](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-6-5a2a70a5.jpeg)\n\n[![Video](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-13-a1192623.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Z3CVsogsW4)\n\n## The Birth of ConFit: Transforming Lives Through Fitness\n\nUpon his release, Joe immersed himself in university life, with a focus on social change. The discipline and escape that fitness provided him in prison now formed the core of ConFit. He recognised the power of exercise in instilling a sense of control and purpose.\n\n> \"In every inmate’s life, there are these moments where they’re like, I want to do something different.\"\n\nConFit emerged as a gym and pathways program designed to help ex-inmates find stability through education and employment. Joe's vision for ConFit was to bridge the societal gap between ex-inmates and the community, using fitness as a platform for inspiration and change.\n\n> “All trainers and mentors at ConFit are ex-convicts, living testimonies to the redemptive power of fitness and community support,\".\n\nThe opening of ConFit’s first gym in Parramatta is a monumental step towards this mission, providing a non-judgmental space for transformation and growth.\n\nJoe's journey from a prison cell to leading a socially impactful enterprise is a testament to the power of mentorship, education, and resilience. Through ConFit, he aspires to break the cycle of reoffending, one person at a time, transforming lives through the unifying power of fitness.\n\n![Confit phases and measurement](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-7-88a1e068.png)\n\n![Back inside but with a different purpose](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-8-97235de7.jpeg)\n\n![The Confit Pathways model](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-9-4820a20b.png)\n\n## Shattering Stereotypes: Redefining Ex-Convicts\n\nConFit boldly addresses recidivism by challenging prevailing stereotypes about ex-convicts. In a society where former inmates are often viewed with suspicion, Joe's initiative highlights their potential for positive transformation. ConFit shines a light on their resilience and eagerness to contribute constructively to society.\n\n> \"Navigating life post-jail with a criminal record is tough. No one wants to hire you. That's why I created ConFit – to bridge the gap between society and those with prison experience through fitness.\"\n\nConsider Michael's journey: once an ex-convict, now a dedicated fitness trainer through ConFit's support. His transformation defies the common narrative of ex-inmates being doomed to reoffend. This success story illustrates the impact of offering support and opportunities to ex-convicts, steering them towards societal contributions.\n\nConFit's approach serves as a strong counter to the stigma surrounding ex-convicts. It proves that with the right support and community, individuals can redefine their futures.\n\n> \"The code in jail – a code of silence, where your word is everything – often doesn't lead to positive outcomes. So, I created the G Code based on gratitude, goal-setting, groundedness. It's about appreciating the little we had, setting goals to move forward, and staying grounded in the present.\"\n\n![Getting busy with the lads in detention](/images/articles/from-shadows-to-spotlight-joe-kwons-redemption-and-the-rise-of-confit-10-292fd101.jpeg)\n\nConFit operates in the detention centres in NSW, focusing on fitness, self-esteem, and life skills for young individuals. The G-code, emphasising goal-setting, groundedness, and gratitude, equips them for life outside detention.\n\nA noteworthy success from the program was a young participant, who post-program, was the first in his family to attend the University of New South Wales. This achievement highlights the program's effectiveness.\n\nConFit Pathways' comprehensive approach includes physical fitness, mental health support, education, and employment guidance.
