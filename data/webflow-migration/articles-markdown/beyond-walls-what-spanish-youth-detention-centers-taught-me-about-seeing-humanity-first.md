# Beyond Walls: What Spanish Youth Detention Centers Taught Me About Seeing Humanity First

*Part 1 of "Reimagining Youth Justice: A Journey Beyond Walls"*

In the morning light filtering through the windows of Diagrama's La Zarza centre, I witnessed what can only be described as a quiet revolution. Young people—many convicted of serious offenses—engaged in conversation with staff who carried no weapons, wore no uniforms, displayed no badges of authority. Just humans connecting with humans.

This scene represents the profound paradox at the heart of effective youth justice: the most secure facilities are those where connection, not control, forms the foundation.

## The Courage to See Beyond Labels

"We aren't jailers," explained Jesús Teruel, Territorial Director for Murcia, as we walked corridors that felt more like a school than a detention centre. "We're not just enforcing a sentence to pass the months until they leave. We're here to work with them, to transmit values, to show them there's a different way."

This perspective requires something our system often lacks: the courage to see beyond the offence to the young person behind it. To recognize that a 15-year-old who has committed a serious crime isn't defined by their worst moment but contains multitudes—trauma, yes, but also dreams, talents, and the capacity for transformation.

In Australia, we've responded to youth crime with increasingly punitive measures—building higher walls, imposing longer sentences, creating harsher conditions. Yet our recidivism rates show the failure of this approach. We keep doing more of what doesn't work, hoping for different results.

## The Art of Human Connection

What struck me most wasn't sophisticated programs or cutting-edge facilities, but something far more fundamental: the quality of human connection. Staff members knew each young person's story, their triggers, their aspirations. They navigated conflicts not with power and control but with genuine curiosity and respect.

One staff member shared, "Before we can expect them to change, they need to feel that someone genuinely cares about their future. Not because it's our job, but because we see their worth."

This isn't sentimentality—it's strategy. Young people who feel seen and valued develop something essential to behavioral change: a sense that they have something to lose by returning to old patterns.

## The Mountain Before Us

Transforming Australia's approach to youth justice feels like a mountain almost too steep to climb. We face entrenched attitudes, political complexity, and the inertia of systems resistant to change.

But standing in Diagrama's centres, watching young people engaged in education, vocational training, and meaningful conversation, I was reminded that Spain once stood where we stand now. Their journey toward transformation began with individuals brave enough to imagine differently.

Each interaction I witnessed at Diagrama reflected a fundamental truth: walls alone cannot create safety. True security emerges when young people develop internal resources—the ability to regulate emotions, resolve conflicts, and envision a future worth working toward.

## The Journey Home

As I prepare to return to Australia, I carry with me not just program details or statistics, but living proof of what's possible when we prioritise humanity in our justice system.

The journey ahead is long and complex. It will require challenging deeply held beliefs about punishment and accountability. It will demand that we reimagine not just our facilities but our fundamental relationship with young people who offend.

But I've seen the destination, and it's worth the climb.

The revolution waiting in our youth justice system isn't about tearing down walls—it's about seeing through them to the humanity that exists on both sides. When we have the courage to truly see each other, transformation becomes not just possible, but inevitable.

The mountain before us is steep, but the view from the summit—a just society where every young person has the opportunity to heal, grow, and contribute—calls us forward, one step at a time.

Together, we climb.

## Key Insights:

- Spanish youth detention centers achieve lower recidivism through relationship-based approaches
- Staff view themselves as mentors and educators, not guards or jailers
- Young people respond to authentic human connection more than control measures
- The environment feels more like a school than a prison
- Transformation begins with seeing the person beyond their offense
- Australia's punitive approach continues to fail despite evidence
