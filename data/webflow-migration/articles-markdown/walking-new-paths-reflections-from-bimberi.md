## Walking New Paths: Reflections from Bimberi

Through patient observation and deep listening at Bimberi Youth Justice Centre, young people's connection to sneaker culture sparked a journey of creative possibility. Their designs now carry stories of hope beyond institutional walls, reminding us that transformation begins when we honor young people's vision for their own futures.

### The Power of Sneaker Culture

At Bimberi, the youth's passion for sneakers became a gateway to creativity and self-expression. By engaging with this interest, facilitators were able to connect with the young people on a deeper level, fostering an environment where their voices were heard and valued.

### Designing a Future

The sneaker design project allowed the youth to explore their creativity and envision a future beyond the confines of the institution. Each design tells a unique story, reflecting the individual's hopes, dreams, and aspirations.

### A Journey of Transformation

This initiative highlights the importance of listening to young people and supporting their visions for their own futures. By providing them with the tools and opportunities to express themselves, we can help them embark on a journey of transformation and growth.
