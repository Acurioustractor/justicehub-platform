We're building a nationwide network to connect and amplify the efforts of 26 communities across Australia that are leading justice reinvestment initiatives. Our goal is to create a platform for sharing knowledge, stories, and solutions in youth justice reform.

## Introduction

Justice reinvestment is a data-driven approach to reducing incarceration and improving public safety by investing in community-based solutions. In Australia, 26 communities are at the forefront of this movement, leading initiatives that focus on addressing the underlying causes of crime and creating opportunities for positive change.

## Building a Network

To support these efforts, we are establishing a nationwide network that connects these communities, allowing them to share knowledge, stories, and solutions. This network aims to amplify their voices and provide a platform for collaboration and innovation in youth justice reform.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this network is to foster a collaborative environment where communities can learn from each other and develop effective strategies for justice reinvestment. By sharing resources and experiences, we hope to create a more equitable and just society for all Australians.

## Conclusion

Through this network, we aim to create a sustainable model for justice reinvestment that can be replicated across the country. By empowering communities and supporting their initiatives, we can work towards a future where justice is accessible and fair for everyone.
