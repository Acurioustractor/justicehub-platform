The phone rings at 3am in a house on Riley Street, Mount Isa. Aunty Corrine doesn't hesitate. She knows what it means.

Another young person in trouble. Another night on the streets. Another family in crisis.

She wakes her partner. They get in the car. By 4am, they're driving slowly through the Bronx, headlights cutting through the dark, looking for the boys everyone else has given up on.

This is what community-led youth justice looks like. Not in a government report. Not in a funded program. In an Aunty's car, at 4 in the morning, picking up kids nobody else will touch.

"Me and the old man used to get in our car, go get 'em off the street at three, four o'clock in the morning," Aunty Corrine tells me, matter-of-fact, like it's the most ordinary thing in the world. "Discipline them 'cause they could have did a lot of damage."

She's been doing this for 20 years. Unpaid. Every single day.

While services with multi-million-dollar budgets work 9 to 5, Aunty Corrine works whenever young people need her. Which is usually the middle of the night.

## The 25

Over two decades, Aunty Corrine has "taken on" 25 young people. That's her language—not "served," not "supported," not "case-managed." **Taken on.**

Like family. Like responsibility. Like forever.

"I took on all these young boys," she says, walking me through the living room where so many of them slept, grew up, learned to share, learned they mattered. "They used to call themselves the M Valley boys 'cause we live in Mornington Valley. All these boys kept coming here."

Some came because they had nowhere else to go. Some came because their mothers couldn't handle them. Some came running from violence. Some came because other kids said, "Go to Aunty Corrine's. You'll be safe there."

"All they wanted," she says simply, "was just someone to show 'em a lot of love and attention."

Twenty-five young people. No intake forms. No eligibility criteria. No funding.

Just: _Are you okay?_

### Steven's Story

Steven is 21 now, sitting in Aunty's living room the day I visit. Quiet, polite, independent.

He came here from Cleveland Youth Detention Centre. Two pages of criminal history from Townsville. His mother couldn't manage. The system had written him off.

"When he came outta Cleveland," Aunty remembers, "he told them mob to send him straight back to Mount Isa. So we took this young fella on too. Got him into school, got him off the streets."

No Youth Justice worker met him at the gate. No transition plan. No support services.

Just Aunty.

"We supported his mom by phone, plus my daughter Jocelyn, when he was in Cleveland," she explains. The family connection—that's what Cleveland tried to sever. That's what Aunty maintained.

Steven hasn't been in trouble since he arrived. He's building a life. Working. Staying out of the system that nearly destroyed him.

This is what successful diversion looks like. Not a program that ended. A family that didn't.

### The Boy Who Sat Silently

Not every story starts with drama. Sometimes it starts with silence.

"I had another young fella come in. He sat in my house for four days. I never questioned him."

Four days. No interrogation. No intake assessment. No pressure.

"I just kept walking past him, and then I said to him, 'Are you okay?'"

That's when he told her: his uncle wanted to stab him.

"I said, 'Right, well, I'm gonna ring the police.' Got the police involved, and guess what, the kid's doing okay now."

This is what trauma-informed practice actually looks like. Not a training module. Not a checklist. **Patience.** Presence. Waiting until someone is ready.

Aunty doesn't have a degree in social work. She doesn't need one. She understands people.

Four days of silence is four days of safety. That's enough.

## What Services Don't See

Aunty Corrine has a phrase she uses a lot: **"Tick-and-flick funding."**

She's explaining the economics of the youth justice industrial complex, though she wouldn't use that academic language. She'd just tell you what she sees.

"A lot of these services got here, it's just all a big competition," she says, leaning forward, making sure I'm hearing this. "We don't need that many services. We should make do with what we got."

She pauses. Decides to say the thing she knows might get her in trouble.

"Don't keep bringing in new services because it's all about dollar signs. **Tick-and-flick funding keep rolling in for what? Because we still got a lot of bad children on the streets.**"

Let that sink in.

Services get funding based on how many young people they "serve." More young people in the system means more funding. The incentive isn't to help kids thrive and leave—it's to keep them in the system, keep counting them, keep justifying the budget.

One visit = one number = funding secured.

Tick. Flick.

Meanwhile, Aunty works with the same 25 young people for years. Some for a decade. She doesn't get paid per interaction. She doesn't get paid at all.

### The Five Services That Won't Talk

I ask Aunty about coordination between services. She laughs. Not a happy laugh.

"You had five services dealing with one child," she says. "Would never come to the table, the five services, to sit down at the table and talk about where they are with this one child."

Five services. Same kid. Won't talk to each other.

"It was like a big competition here. This service better than that service."

While they compete, Aunty is the only one connecting the dots. She talks to the police. She talks to child protection. She talks to the school. She talks to the housing worker. She talks to mental health.

She's the only person who sees the whole young person.

And she does it for free.

### When Things Work, Funding Gets Cut

Aunty tells me about a program called VOP—Voice of Peace. Run by a woman named Amy, along with a young Aboriginal worker named Lana who has since passed away.

"They came here, knocked on my door. I told 'em to come back next day. I pulled 15 boys outta my house. Out of the 15, they ended up with six."

Six boys actively engaged. Real relationships building. The program working.

Then: "When I rang up about the program VOP, they lost the funding and it never happened again."

She leans back. Her tone shifts from storytelling to analysis.

"That VOP program should have been continuing still today, 2025. But because they've lost the funding, or government didn't want to fund it again. **Because you know when something start looking really good and deadly, you get the funding taken away. They don't want things to look great and good out here in Mount Isa.**"

I don't know if it's intentional sabotage or just the cruelty of short-term grant cycles. Either way, the result is the same.

Programs that work die just when they're working.

## "I Need Voices Behind Me"

Aunty Corrine speaks at every meeting. She shows up to consultations she wasn't invited to. She asks the first question to get everyone else talking.

"Every meeting I go to, I always say that," she tells me, referring to her habit of calling out failures. "And a lot of people say, 'Oh, you need to stop running your mouth or you're gonna get in trouble.'"

She doesn't stop.

"I say, 'I don't care because it's our children that miss out.'"

She's been on ABC Four Corners. She's spoken to people from Parliament. She's taken five police officers to court for misconduct—and won every single case. Those officers will never get promoted. They'll stay constables for the rest of their careers.

"They were really crying, them coppers," she recalls. "They said, 'Oh, we can never get a promotion.' I said, 'You don't deserve one.'"

This is what accountability looks like when community members refuse to be silent.

But Aunty is tired. Not of the work—she'll never stop that. Tired of doing it alone.

"I got the voice," she says quietly. Then adds the line that breaks my heart: **"But I got no backup."**

Later in our conversation, she says it differently: "I will support you, but I need voices behind me to make things work in this community."

That's what community-led actually means. Not one Aunty carrying the weight of 25 young people plus systemic failure. **Collective power.** Organized support. Infrastructure.

Backup.

## What Aunty Actually Needs

I ask Aunty what help would look like. What she needs.

She doesn't hesitate.

**Not more services.**

"I don't care if I get myself in trouble," she says again, making sure I understand she's about to challenge the entire system. "A lot of these services got here, it's just all a big competition. We don't need that many services."

So what then?

"We need less services, more facilities and infrastructure."

She explains: Mount Isa has parks for dogs. Not for kids.

"I went into the police station one day and said, 'Where am I supposed to take all these kids? Put 'em all on a dog leash and take 'em to the dog park? Because there's more dog parks in Mount Isa than any other parks.'"

The town pool is too expensive for families. There are no after-hours activities. No public transport to get kids to school. No safe spaces for young people to just exist without being criminalized.

"You gotta join services for your kids to go to these places, which is really sad," Aunty says.

Think about that. To access a basic activity—a swim, a basketball court, a youth program—you have to sign up with a service. Get case-managed. Become a number in someone's funding report.

Just to play basketball.

### What Happens at Night

The other thing Aunty needs: support when young people actually need it.

"I know they all here to try and support and help our kids," she says, giving services the benefit of the doubt even as she's about to critique them. "The saddest part about it, a lot of things happen at night. It starts from five in the afternoon."

She's right. I've seen it in communities across Australia. Five pm, the sun starts to set, young people come out. That's when they need connection, activities, someone to talk to.

That's when services close.

"Kids start walking on the streets five o'clock in the afternoon," Aunty continues. "We've got more services working during the day. **We need 'em at night.**"

Instead, it's Aunty and other community members who are out there. 3am. 4am. Unpaid.

While co-responders earning close to $60 an hour work daytime shifts.

## The Economics Nobody Talks About

Let me do the math that nobody else will.

Aunty Corrine does:
- Cross-system case coordination (police, courts, child protection, housing, mental health, education)
- 24/7 crisis response
- Long-term relational support (years, not weeks)
- Cultural authority and Elder knowledge
- Family advocacy and navigation
- Court support
- Housing advocacy
- Emergency accommodation in her own home
- Food, clothing, transport for young people
- Trauma-informed crisis intervention

If you billed this at professional rates:
- Case coordinator: $40-50/hour
- Crisis worker: $50-60/hour
- Cultural consultant: $80-100/hour
- After-hours loading: Time-and-a-half

Conservative estimate: **$800-1,200 per day**

Multiply that by:
- 25 young people supported
- 20 years of work
- Often multiple young people simultaneously

We're talking about **millions of dollars** in unpaid community expertise.

Meanwhile, Aunty gets: $0.

Co-responders (a service Aunty says "we don't need in this community") get close to $60/hour.

Services with multi-million budgets "tick-and-flick" through their caseloads.

And Aunty picks up kids at 3am.

This is what extraction looks like. Community knowledge, community labor, community expertise—used to make government systems look like they're working—while community members subsidize that work for free.

## Cleveland - Where Young People Disappear

I need to tell you about Cleveland Youth Detention Centre. Because Aunty Corrine sees what families experience when the state takes their children.

In an earlier conversation, Aunty told me about trying to visit her grandson Benjamin at Cleveland. They'd arranged a special Sunday visitation for her. She drove from Mount Isa to Townsville—hours on the road.

Waited in a room she describes as "very lonely, very depressing, very stressful."

Staff came back. Said her grandson "didn't want to visit because he was sick."

She went home heartbroken.

The next day, Benjamin called her.

"I said, 'You know, I went over there waiting to visit you, darling.' He said, 'No one ever came near me.'"

So who's lying? The staff or the child?

Aunty knows. "See, I could have jumped up and down and made a lot of noise. That's Cleveland."

This is what families experience. Not just denial of contact—denial of truth. Gaslighting. A black box where young people go in and come out worse.

"Cleveland really needs to be investigated," Aunty says quietly. "Because they're not doing the right thing by our children down there."

When Steven came out of Cleveland, there was no transition support. No Youth Justice worker. No plan.

Just Aunty, waiting to receive another young person the system had failed.

## What Two Years of Love Can Do

I want to end with a success story. Because Aunty has many, even if they don't fit neatly into "program outcomes" and "completion rates."

Her son Norton. Aunty worked with him for two years to join the Army.

"Norton was the one that stepped up. He stopped the drugs. He did everything himself just to go into the army. It took me two years to work with just Norton, but he got there eventually."

Two years. Not a six-week program. Not a 12-month intervention. **Two years of sustained family support.**

Norton made it. Joined the Army. Aunty was so proud.

Then his cousin fell sick with motor neuron disease. Norton came home for the funeral. Never went back to the Army.

Then he had a major motorbike accident. Seriously injured.

Is this a "failed outcome"? By service delivery metrics, yes. Program incomplete. Didn't sustain employment.

But Aunty doesn't see it that way. She sees a son who got the opportunity. Who proved he could do it. Who came home when family needed him. Who's still here, still okay, still connected.

That's success. Not the kind that fits in a funding report. The kind that matters.

## The Courage to Say It

Near the end of our conversation, Aunty tells me something that makes me understand her even better.

A counselor once told her: "I could learn a lot from you."

Then, weeks later, Aunty's sister went to see that same counselor. The counselor ended up crying on her sister's lap. "My sister was counseling the counselor," Aunty says.

Then a doctor: "I went to the doctor. He put his pen down and he looked at me and he said, 'You know, I could learn a lot from you.'"

Professionals with university degrees learn from Aunty Corrine.

But she doesn't get a paycheck.

Let me say that again: **Professionals with university degrees learn from Aunty Corrine. But she doesn't get a paycheck.**

This is the choice embedded in every funding decision:
- Pay services that "tick-and-flick"? Or pay Aunties who transform lives?
- Fund 9-to-5 programs? Or fund 24/7 community care?
- Invest in competition between services? Or invest in collective community power?

Australia chooses the first option. Every time.

And Aunties keep working anyway. Because it's "all from the heart."

But hearts get tired. Even Aunty Corrine's.

## The Backup She Deserves

I ask Aunty if she has any final thoughts. Anything she wants people to know.

She thinks for a moment. Then says it plainly:

"I don't care if I get myself in trouble. A lot of these services got here, it's just all a big competition. We don't need that many services. We should make do with what we got. Don't keep bringing in new services because it's all about dollar signs."

She pauses. Makes sure I'm still recording.

"**Tick-and-flick funding keep rolling in for what? Because we still got a lot of bad children on the streets. We still got a lot of bad children not even in school.**"

Then she says the thing I can't stop thinking about:

"I will support you, but I need voices behind me to make things work in this community."

Twenty years. Twenty-five young people. Countless 3am pickups. Hundreds of court appearances. Thousands of meals, beds, conversations, moments of just being there when everyone else had given up.

All unpaid. All from the heart.

Aunty Corrine has the voice. She's been using it for two decades.

What she needs now is backup. Voices behind her. Infrastructure to support what she's been building alone.

Not more services competing for funding. Not more consultations where her knowledge gets extracted. Not more meetings where she has to ask the first question to get everyone else talking.

What she needs is simple:
- **Compensation** for the professional-level work she already does
- **Infrastructure** for young people (parks, not programs; pools, not paperwork)
- **Collective power** so she's not carrying this alone
- **Long-term investment** in what actually works (like VOP, like community-led support)
- **Recognition** that she's not a "community member providing input"—she's an expert deserving of a salary

This is what community-led looks like. Not a grant-funded pilot program. Not a consultation session. Not an advisory committee.

**An Aunty. A house on Riley Street. A phone that rings at 3am. And the courage to answer it. Every single time.**

For 20 years.

The question isn't whether Aunty Corrine's work is valuable. The question is whether we're finally ready to fund it.

## Author's Note

This story is based on two recorded conversations with Aunty Corrine in Mount Isa, November 2024. All quotes are verbatim from those conversations. Aunty Corrine reviewed this story before publication and approved it for public sharing.

If you're a funder, policymaker, or service provider reading this: the solutions you're looking for already exist. In communities. In Aunties who've been doing this work for decades.

The only question is whether you're ready to fund them—or whether you'll keep funding services to replicate what they've already built.
