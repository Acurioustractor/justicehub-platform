# The Diagrama Model: A Transformative Approach to Youth Justice

The Diagrama Model transforms youth justice by shifting from punishment to rehabilitation. It operates education-driven, therapy-supported re-education centers where young offenders receive individualized care, vocational training, and strong mentorship to break cycles of reoffending. Unlike traditional detention, Diagrama fosters positive relationships, autonomy-building, and community integration, leading to lower recidivism rates and better long-term outcomes. The model is cost-effective, humane, and adaptable, making it a promising alternative for youth justice reform in Australia and beyond.
