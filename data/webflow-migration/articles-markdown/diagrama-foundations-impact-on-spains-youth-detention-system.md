This approach has significantly reduced recidivism rates and improved overall outcomes for the youth involved.

## Key Initiatives

- **Vocational Training**: Offering practical skills training to prepare youth for employment post-detention.
- **Social Reintegration**: Facilitating programs that help integrate young offenders back into their communities, fostering a sense of belonging and purpose.

## Impact and Results

Since its inception, the Diagrama Foundation has seen remarkable success in reducing repeat offenses among its participants. The foundation's holistic approach not only addresses the immediate needs of young offenders but also lays the groundwork for long-term societal benefits.

## Conclusion

The Diagrama Foundation's work in Spain serves as a model for youth detention reform worldwide. By focusing on rehabilitation and reintegration, the foundation has demonstrated that a compassionate approach can yield positive outcomes for individuals and communities alike.
