## Executive Summary

Government investment in youth crime prevention is a welcome and timely step. To truly **transform young lives and enhance community safety**, however, programs must meet a *gold standard* of design and delivery. This position paper outlines a vision for gold-standard youth crime prevention and practical guidance on designing "kickstarter" initiatives that change life trajectories for at-risk youth. Key points include:

- **Embrace Evidence-Based Interventions:** Funding alone won't reduce youth crime unless programs use proven, evidence-informed strategies targeting the root causes of offending. Gold-standard initiatives incorporate what works – from family support to cognitive-behavioral training – rather than untested ideas.
- **Design for Lasting Impact:** "Kickstarter" programs should serve as true turning points in a young person's life. This means providing **intensive, personalized support** (mentoring, education, job pathways) that engages youth long-term, not one-off short courses. Effective models have halved re-offending rates by addressing underlying needs.
- **Strengthen Accountability:** To ensure success, clear outcomes and standards must be set from the start. We recommend rigorous selection criteria for funding, **key performance indicators**, independent evaluations, and transparent progress reporting. This holds program providers accountable and enables continuous improvement.

In summary, the government's new funding commitment (e.g. Queensland's $100 million for *"gold standard early intervention"*) provides an unprecedented opportunity. By adhering to evidence-based principles and high standards, these initiatives can divert young people from crime, delivering safer communities and brighter futures. The following paper details the current gaps and offers recommendations to realise this vision.

## Current Approach: Progress and Gaps

**Positive Steps:** Governments increasingly recognise that *"one of the best ways to reduce crime is to intervene early"*. Recent commitments – such as Queensland's new **$50 million "Kickstarter" grants program** for community-led youth interventions – demonstrate commendable intent. This fresh focus on prevention and support (education, life skills, and mentoring) is a constructive shift away from sole reliance on punitive measures. It acknowledges that locking up youth is neither a sustainable nor effective solution.

**Lingering Gaps:** Despite good intentions, past approaches to youth crime have fallen short of gold-standard practice. Many programs were launched without a strong evidence base or clear theory of change, leading to uneven results. Oversight bodies have noted a *lack of robust data collection, independent evaluation and outcome monitoring* in youth justice initiatives. Without evidence-based design and rigorous evaluation, even well-funded programs risk failing to reduce reoffending.

Moreover, there has historically been an **imbalance between investment in incarceration vs. prevention**. Taxpayers spend enormous sums detaining young offenders (over **$760,000 per youth annually** in Queensland), yet this *"failing system"* does little to rehabilitate and often leads to further crime. In contrast, prevention programs have been comparatively under-resourced and fragmented. Small, short-term projects may lack the scale or continuity to truly change a young person's trajectory. This reactive tilt not only strains budgets but also misses the opportunity to address problems *before* crimes occur.

**Risk of Status Quo:** If new funding simply bolsters a patchwork of unproven initiatives or is driven by political urgency rather than evidence, the outcome will likely mirror past disappointments. Young people may cycle through programs that provide temporary activity but no lasting impact on behaviour or wellbeing. The community will see little safety benefit if underlying drivers (such as family dysfunction, trauma, mental health issues, or disengagement from school) remain unaddressed. In short, **without adherence to high standards, increased spending alone will not deliver the promised reduction in youth crime**. It is crucial to turn positive intent into effective action by defining and implementing true gold-standard practices.

## Defining Gold-Standard Youth Crime Prevention

What does "gold standard" youth crime prevention look like in practice? It goes far beyond traditional lectures or ad-hoc activities. A gold-standard approach is **comprehensive, evidence-driven, and youth-centred**. Key principles include:

- **Evidence-Based Strategies:** Gold-standard programs are built on approaches proven to reduce youth offending or address its risk factors. This could mean adopting validated models (for example, *family therapy interventions that have cut re-offending by 25–50%*) or designing new initiatives informed by research. Programs should target known drivers of youth crime – such as substance abuse, poor school attachment, lack of job skills, family conflict, and trauma – using methods shown to work (e.g. cognitive-behavioural techniques to improve decision-making and emotional regulation).
- **Holistic and Multi-Faceted Services:** No single issue leads a young person to crime, and no single-service intervention will pull them out. Gold-standard prevention addresses the **full spectrum of needs**. This means combining **family engagement, education support, mentoring, mental health services, and positive recreational outlets** into an integrated plan. Successful initiatives often provide each youth with a *trusted mentor or caseworker*, training in life and social skills, family counselling, and help reconnecting with school or employment. By stabilizing a young person's environment and relationships, we remove the conditions that foster criminal behaviour.
- **Early and Targeted Intervention:** The most effective prevention begins **early and targets those at greatest risk**. Resources should be directed to identify vulnerable children and teens *before* they offend or in the very initial encounters with the justice system. Gold-standard programs use data-driven risk assessment to focus on youths with multiple risk factors (such as prior offences, truancy, or family instability) and deliver support at critical turning points (for instance, during the transition from primary to secondary school, or immediately after a minor first offence). This targeting ensures intensive help is provided where it can have the biggest impact, rather than diluting effort on youths unlikely to reoffend.
- **Intensive, Sustained Engagement:** To truly change life trajectories, interventions must be of sufficient intensity and duration. Gold-standard programs do not consist of one-off workshops or a few weeks of engagement – they **stay with the young person for the long haul**. International best practice shows that interventions yielding real results are *intensive (daily or weekly contact), individualised to each youth's circumstances, and sustained over months or years* as needed. This might include daily after-school activities, 24/7 on-call support in a crisis, or long-term mentoring relationships. Consistency and trust built over time make youth more receptive to guidance, and allow programs to weather setbacks and show gradual progress.
- **Youth-Centred and Culturally Informed:** Gold-standard prevention meets youth **where they are**. Programs should be engaging and relevant to young people's lives, using approaches that empower youth rather than lecture them. This could involve hands-on learning (e.g. music, sports, or tech projects that build skills and self-esteem) and giving youth a voice in setting goals. Interventions must also be **culturally appropriate** – for example, working with Indigenous elders and community leaders when supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, to ensure respect for cultural identity and to leverage community strengths. A one-size-fits-all approach will not be as effective as one that recognises and responds to the diverse backgrounds of at-risk youth.

By adhering to these principles, a program truly earns the "gold standard" label. It means a young person in the program receives the kind of comprehensive, persistent support that research shows can **divert them from crime and set them on a positive path**. Such approaches have been shown to significantly cut re-offending and even yield *better public safety outcomes than incarceration*, and at far lower cost. In short, gold-standard prevention turns the curve on youth crime by treating its causes – it is proactive, not reactive.

## Designing Transformative "Kickstarter" Programs

With a clear vision of gold-standard practices, how should government design and fund a new **"Kickstarter" program** so that it **actually transforms lives**? The term suggests a catalyst or a launch pad – in this context, programs that give at-risk youth a genuine fresh start. Designing such initiatives involves several critical elements:

- **Clear Objectives and Theory of Change:** A transformative program begins with clear, **outcome-focused goals**. For example: reducing reoffending among participants by a certain percentage, improving school attendance, or increasing job placements. The program should have a well-defined *theory of change* that explains how its activities lead to those outcomes (e.g. "providing a mentor + job training will improve employment prospects and thereby reduce criminal involvement"). This logical framework, grounded in evidence, guides the program design and helps everyone understand what "success" looks like.
- **Co-Design with Community and Youth:** Government should leverage the knowledge of **community organisations, families, and the youth themselves** in program design. Local non-profits and youth workers often know what approaches resonate with young people in their area. Engaging them in co-design ensures the program is culturally sensitive and addresses real needs. For instance, Queensland's new grants rightly encourage *"community-led initiatives"* for youth support. Going further, involving some young people (including former offenders or youth with lived experience) in planning can bring invaluable insight into what might motivate a teenager to choose a better path. This collaborative design builds local buy-in and makes programs more approachable for participants.
- **Wraparound Support and Coaching:** A "kickstarter" program that changes lives must provide **wraparound support** – covering the many facets of a young person's life. This typically includes assigning each youth a dedicated mentor or caseworker who acts as a consistent, positive adult in their life. It also involves working on educational engagement (tutoring or alternative schooling opportunities), job readiness (vocational training, apprenticeships), life skills (communication, financial literacy), and personal development (counselling for trauma, mental health services). Notably, effective programs often *combine mentoring with cognitive-behavioural skill building and family involvement*. For example, a mentor might help a youth practice anger management techniques learned in therapy, or mediate a family meeting to improve home dynamics. This 360-degree approach ensures that as the youth's outlook changes, their environment and skills also improve to support a crime-free life.
- **Innovation with Fidelity:** Government should encourage innovative solutions – especially for complex issues like youth crime – but innovation must be balanced with **fidelity to what works**. This means funded programs can try new methods or culturally tailored approaches, yet they should incorporate core components that research indicates are effective. For instance, a novel indigenous youth project might blend cultural healing practices with proven mentoring and educational support. Proposals for funding should be required to articulate how their design draws on evidence or established best practices. Where completely new approaches are piloted, they should include strong evaluation plans (discussed below) to quickly identify whether they are delivering the intended impact.
- **Adequate Duration and Intensity:** A common pitfall in youth initiatives is **insufficient duration or intensity** – expecting major life changes from minimal contact. Truly transformative programs avoid this by ensuring each participant receives substantial attention and time. Funding agreements should reflect the need for multi-month or multi-year engagement, rather than short-term intakes. For example, if the aim is to get a 16-year-old chronic truant back into education and employment, a program might work with them steadily over 12+ months: first stabilising their personal circumstances, then coaching them through a training course, and finally helping them secure and maintain a job. During this period, **intensive support** (possibly daily check-ins or small group sessions multiple times a week) helps maintain momentum. Global evidence supports this – interventions that are *"intensive, tailored to individual needs, and trauma-informed"* have far greater success. Governments should thus design funding to enable depth over breadth: it is better to thoroughly transform 100 high-risk youths' lives than to briefly touch 1,000 youths with no lasting change.
- **Skilled Delivery Teams:** Even the best-designed program will falter without the right people delivering it. Government and grant-makers should ensure that funded initiatives have (or develop) the **workforce capacity** to execute the program with quality. This means investing in training youth workers, educators, and counsellors in the chosen methodologies (for example, training mentors in cognitive-behavioural coaching techniques). Programs should ideally employ staff with relevant qualifications or lived experience and a genuine commitment to helping youth. High staff-to-participant ratios are often needed for intensive work. Additionally, ongoing supervision and support for staff (to prevent burnout and maintain fidelity to the program model) is crucial. When scaling up programs, consider phased growth so quality is not compromised by rapid expansion.

When these design elements come together, the "kickstarter" program can truly alter a young person's life trajectory. For instance, imagine a youth who was on the brink of entering the justice system: through a comprehensive program, he gets back into school, receives therapy for trauma, finds a supportive peer group in program activities, and gains work experience. Such a youth not only avoids crime but builds a positive identity and future – the ultimate goal of transformative intervention. **The payoff for society is substantial**: research confirms that well-implemented community interventions can yield greater reductions in reoffending than incarceration *and* do so at a fraction of the cost. In designing kickstarter programs, governments have the chance to replace cycles of crime and custody with cycles of opportunity and growth.

## Ensuring Accountability and Success

Achieving high standards in youth crime prevention is not just about initial design – it requires **strong accountability and continuous improvement mechanisms**. Governments must put in place structures to ensure that programs deliver on their promises and public funds are used effectively. Key recommendations include:

- **Set Clear Metrics and Targets:** At the outset, define what success looks like in measurable terms. For example, targets might include *reduction in recidivism rates among participants, increased school attendance, improved employment rates, or fewer arrests*. Each funded program should contribute to these broader outcomes as appropriate. By establishing **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** early, both funders and service providers know how progress will be judged. These metrics should be realistic and aligned with the program's theory of change (e.g. don't expect a dramatic crime drop in 3 months for a heavily disadvantaged cohort – allow time for change).
- **Robust Monitoring and Data Collection:** Programs must collect and report data regularly to track their performance against the targets. This includes enrollment numbers, participant demographics, services delivered, and short-term outcomes (like skills gained or program completion rates), leading up to long-term outcomes (like offence rates 12 months post-program). **Integrated data systems** or requirements for data sharing (with appropriate privacy safeguards) can help monitor if youth are reoffending or improving in school. The Queensland Audit Office found that poor data capture in the past made it *"difficult to conclude whether [strategies were] effective"*. We must not repeat that mistake. Real-time monitoring allows for course corrections – if a tactic isn't engaging youth, programs can adjust quickly rather than waiting for a year-end review.
- **Independent Evaluation:** Every pilot or newly funded model should include resources for **independent evaluation** by qualified researchers or evaluators. Independent evaluators can design impact assessments (e.g. comparing outcomes of participants to similar youth not in the program) to determine if the program is actually achieving its goals. This can range from qualitative feedback from participants to rigorous quantitative studies (ideally, over time, some programs could even be tested with control groups or other high-quality evaluation methods to establish causality). Importantly, evaluation findings – whether positive or negative – must be transparent. An independent evaluation and transparent reporting of outcomes were explicitly recommended to strengthen youth crime strategies. Learning what doesn't work is just as important as learning what does. Government should be prepared to pivot or cease funding for approaches that evidence shows are ineffective, and conversely, to expand those that demonstrate success.
- **Governance and Oversight:** Establish a governance mechanism for the overall initiative, such as a steering committee or advisory board comprising government officials, experts, community representatives, and even youth voices. This body can oversee the portfolio of programs, ensure alignment with the strategy's goals, and troubleshoot systemic issues. Regular progress reports should be provided to senior officials and ministers, not just on spending but on outcomes achieved. High-level oversight signals that results matter just as much as effort. It also adds a layer of accountability for keeping the initiative on track toward its crime prevention objectives.
- **Capacity Building and Support:** Holding programs accountable goes hand-in-hand with **supporting them to succeed**. Government departments should not adopt a "fund-and-forget" approach, but rather an active partnership with service providers. This can include offering technical assistance on data collection, facilitating training workshops on evidence-based practices, and fostering a community of practice among grant recipients to share lessons and peer support. If a program is struggling to meet targets, early support or intervention (rather than immediate defunding) can help it improve. Building capacity in the sector is a long-term investment – it will raise the standard of youth interventions generally, beyond just the life of the funding cycle.
- **Sustainable Funding Commitments:** Finally, accountability and success are bolstered when programs have stable funding over a sufficient period. Short funding cycles or uncertainty can undermine performance – staff get anxious about job security, and youth sense when a program might be fleeting. While it is wise to pilot new initiatives, those that show promise or positive early results should be assured continuity (with ongoing monitoring). The government might consider a model where initial grants are for a pilot period (say 1–2 years), followed by an opportunity to secure extended funding (3–5 years) for programs that meet agreed benchmarks. This balance encourages performance and innovation, while also giving successful programs the runway to achieve lasting impact. It also signals to community partners that government is in it for the long haul, building trust and commitment on all sides.

By implementing these accountability measures, the government can **ensure the "gold standard" is more than a slogan** – it becomes the lived reality of every funded program. Taxpayers and communities deserve to know that this significant investment is yielding results. Regular public reporting on outcomes (for example, an annual youth crime prevention report card) can maintain transparency and political support. Crucially, rigorous accountability does not mean being risk-averse – it means we *learn and adapt*. If one approach isn't delivering, we refine or replace it with a better one, continually driving toward the ultimate goal: fewer young lives lost to crime and fewer victims in our communities.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a **true gold-standard youth crime prevention strategy** is within reach – but it will require commitment to high-quality implementation, not just high dollar amounts. The government's recent initiatives and funding promises show the right intent and have created momentum for change. This paper has argued that to convert that intent into tangible results, policymakers must insist on evidence-based, well-designed programs and a culture of accountability for outcomes.

By investing wisely in *what works* – comprehensive early intervention that supports youths' needs, builds their skills, and heals underlying issues – we can expect to see real dividends: **reduced offending, improved lives, and safer communities**. On the other hand, falling short of gold-standard practice risks wasting resources and failing the very youth we aim to help. There is perhaps no greater return on investment than turning an at-risk teenager away from a path of crime and toward a productive life. Indeed, effective community programs have demonstrated they can cut reoffending more effectively and humanely than the punitive status quo, all while saving public costs in the long run.

This is a pivotal opportunity for the government to set a new course. We recommend establishing clear principles (as outlined above) to guide every grant and project: **evidence, holistic design, proper targeting, strong monitoring, and continuous improvement**. With these in place, the term "gold standard" will not be merely aspirational – it will be reflected in everyday practice, from a youth worker's mentorship session to an executive briefing on crime stats.

The challenges of youth crime are complex, but the solutions are within our grasp if pursued diligently. By partnering with communities and experts, holding ourselves accountable to outcomes, and never losing sight of the human stories behind the statistics, we can create programs that truly **transform lives**. The government can lead by example, ensuring that today's investments deliver a safer, brighter tomorrow for our young people and our society. It is both the compassionate and the **smart** approach – one that will justify the public's trust and build a lasting legacy of positive change.
