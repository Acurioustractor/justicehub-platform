Queensland’s Staying on Track and Regional Reset programs represent a $225 million investment in youth justice rehabilitation and early intervention. While these initiatives have the potential to reduce youth reoffending and support at-risk youth, their success depends on who receives the funding. If large organizations dominate the grants, a significant portion could be absorbed by administrative costs and bureaucracy, rather than directly reaching young people and community-based solutions.

## Introduction

Queensland’s Staying on Track and Regional Reset programs represent a $225 million investment in youth justice rehabilitation and early intervention. While these initiatives have the potential to reduce youth reoffending and support at-risk youth, their success depends on who receives the funding. If large organizations dominate the grants, a significant portion could be absorbed by administrative costs and bureaucracy, rather than directly reaching young people and community-based solutions.

## The Importance of Grassroots Solutions

Grassroots organizations are often more in tune with the specific needs of their communities. They offer tailored solutions that can address the root causes of youth offending, such as family dysfunction, lack of education, and unemployment. By prioritizing funding for these organizations, the government can ensure that resources are used effectively and directly benefit those in need.

## Challenges with Bureaucracy

Large organizations, while capable of managing substantial funds, often have higher administrative costs. This can lead to a significant portion of the funding being used for overheads rather than direct services. Moreover, bureaucratic processes can slow down the implementation of programs, delaying the benefits to the community.

## Conclusion

For Queensland’s youth justice initiatives to be successful, it is crucial to prioritize funding for grassroots solutions. By doing so, the government can ensure that resources are used effectively, directly benefiting young people and their communities.
