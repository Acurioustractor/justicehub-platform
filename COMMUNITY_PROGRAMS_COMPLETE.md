## 🛠️ **Technical Details:**

### File Structure:
```
src/app/
└── community-programs/
    ├── page.tsx           ← Main listing page
    └── [id]/
        └── page.tsx       ← NEW: Individual program pages
```

### Dynamic Routing:
- Uses Next.js App Router dynamic segments `[id]`
- Matches program by ID from URL parameter
- Shows 404 if program not found
- Client-side rendered for interactivity

### Data Source:
- Currently uses hardcoded sample data (same as listing page)
- Ready to be connected to database/API when needed

   - Move program data to Supabase
   - Create `programs` table
   - Update both pages to fetch from DB

2. **Add More Content**
   - Program photos/videos
   - Success stories
   - Testimonials
   - Impact reports

3. **Interactive Features**
   - Referral form
   - Volunteer signup
   - Donation integration
   - Social sharing

4. **SEO Optimization**
   - Add metadata for each program
   - OpenGraph images
   - Structured data (schema.org)

## ✅ **Status: COMPLETE**
