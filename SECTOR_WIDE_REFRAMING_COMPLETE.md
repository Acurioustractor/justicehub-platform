# Sector-Wide Reframing: Implementation Complete

**Completed:** January 2025
**Documents Updated:** 3 core Mindaroo pitch documents
**Purpose:** Reframe JusticeHub from "Indigenous-focus" to "sector-wide platform with Indigenous leadership as gold standard"

---

## Summary of Changes

All three Mindaroo pitch documents have been updated to reflect sector-wide positioning while maintaining Indigenous leadership as central:

### Key Messaging Changes Applied:

✅ **Lead with "all young people"** before specifying Indigenous overrepresentation
✅ **Indigenous leadership framed as expertise/urgency**, not exclusivity
✅ **All community types mentioned early and often** (Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, LGBTQIA+)
✅ **Indigenous data sovereignty as "gold standard"** protecting everyone
✅ **Impact statements show sector-wide benefit**

## Documents Updated

### 1. MINDAROO_CORE_PITCH.md
**Location:** `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/public/docs/strategic/MINDAROO_CORE_PITCH.md`

**Changes Made:**

**Problem Statement (Updated):**
- **Before:** "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are 17 times more likely..."
- **After:** "**Every young person** in Australia's youth justice system deserves better. But the crisis is most acute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people—**17 times more likely** to be in detention..."

**Solution Section (NEW - Added):**
- Added "Why Indigenous Leadership?" section with three clear reasons:
  1. Statistical urgency (17x overrepresentation)
  2. Knowledge sovereignty (Indigenous frameworks set gold standard)
  3. Sector best practice (protects everyone)

**Who JusticeHub Serves (NEW - Added entire section):**
```markdown
**Primary Beneficiaries:** All young people in Australia's youth justice system

**Communities We Engage:**
- Indigenous communities — Leading platform design, setting sovereignty standards
- CALD communities — African Australian, Pasifika, Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern
- Remote non-Indigenous communities — Regional and remote towns
- Disability communities — Young people with cognitive, physical, mental health disabilities
- LGBTQIA+ communities — Gender diverse and sexuality diverse young people
- Mainstream services — Government, NGO, and community practitioners
```

**Impact Statement (Updated):**
- **Before:** Single sentence about young people
- **After:** Detailed breakdown by community type:
  - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people → culturally safe, healing-centered
  - CALD young people → respect for cultural backgrounds
  - Young people with disabilities → trauma-informed care
  - LGBTQIA+ young people → affirming support
  - ALL young people → evidence-based practice

**Bottom Line (Updated):**
- **Before:** "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities own the platform..."
- **After:** "A sector-wide platform serving **all young people** in youth justice, built under Indigenous leadership to the highest standards... **This isn't an Indigenous program—it's sector infrastructure built to Indigenous sovereignty standards, benefiting every young person in the system.**"

**Location:** `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/public/docs/strategic/MINDAROO_ONE_PAGER.md`

**Changes Made:**

**Problem Statement (Updated):**
- **Before:** "Detention statistics tell a clear story—especially for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people..."
- **After:** "**Every young person** in Australia's youth justice system deserves better. The crisis is most acute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people—**17 times more likely** to be in detention—but the knowledge to change this exists across all communities: Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities..."

**Solution Section (Restructured):**
- **Before:** "While the platform is deliberately framed around First Nations leadership..."
- **After:** Added "Why Indigenous Leadership?" section with three-reason structure
  - Statistical urgency
  - Knowledge sovereignty
  - Sector best practice

**What Makes This Different (Updated):**
- Added: "Serves all young people with Indigenous governance setting the gold standard"
- Changed: "Indigenous data sovereignty enforced" → "Indigenous data sovereignty protects everyone"

### 3. MINDAROO_STRATEGIC_PITCH.md
**Location:** `/Users/benknight/Code/JusticeHub/public/docs/strategic/MINDAROO_STRATEGIC_PITCH.md`

**Changes Made:**

**Executive Summary (Updated):**
- **Before:** "JusticeHub is a community-owned digital intelligence platform that realises Indigenous data sovereignty..."
- **After:** "JusticeHub is a community-owned digital intelligence platform serving **all young people** in Australia's youth justice system. Built under **Indigenous leadership** and governed by Indigenous data sovereignty principles, the platform creates sector-wide infrastructure..."

**The Core Problem (Updated):**
- **Before:** "Detention statistics tell a clear story—especially for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people..."
- **After:** "**Every young person** in Australia's youth justice system deserves better.

**Why This Is Different (Updated):**
- Added first bullet: "**Sector-wide infrastructure** — Serves all young people with Indigenous governance setting the gold standard for consent, sovereignty, and community control"
- Changed: "Sector-wide inclusion" → "Indigenous data sovereignty protects everyone — Framework developed for Indigenous communities becomes best practice for CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities"
- Added: "**Fair compensation for all communities** — Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, LGBTQIA+ communities compensated equally ($180K annually)"

**Conclusion (Updated):**

## Key Messaging Framework (Now Consistent Across All Documents)

### ✅ Always Say:

1. "Platform serves **all young people** in youth justice"
2. "Indigenous communities **lead** because of overrepresentation and sovereignty expertise"
3. "Indigenous data sovereignty framework protects **everyone**"
4. "Engaging Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, LGBTQIA+ communities"
5. "Best practice for Indigenous young people = best practice for all young people"

### ❌ Never Say:

1. "Platform for Indigenous young people"
2. "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander focus"
3. "Other communities also included" (implies they're secondary)
4. "Indigenous-specific platform"
5. Language that makes non-Indigenous communities feel like afterthoughts

---

## Mental Model Shift

### ❌ OLD MENTAL MODEL:
```
[Indigenous Communities] ← Primary
[Other Communities] ← Secondary/Also Included
```

### ✅ NEW MENTAL MODEL:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     ALL YOUNG PEOPLE IN YOUTH JUSTICE    │
│                                         │
│  Indigenous | CALD | Remote | Disability | LGBTQIA+  │
│                                         │
│  GOVERNED BY: Indigenous Data Sovereignty Framework  │
│  (Best Practice for Everyone)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**LED BY:** Indigenous communities (17x overrepresentation + sovereignty expertise)
**SERVES:** Everyone

---

## Why These Changes Matter

### Before Reframing:
A CALD practitioner reading the pitch might think: "This is an Indigenous program that also includes others"

### After Reframing:
A CALD practitioner reading the pitch thinks: "This is a sector-wide platform with Indigenous leadership ensuring best practice for everyone, including my communities"

---

## Test Questions (All documents now pass):

✅ **Could a CALD practitioner read this and think "this is for me"?** YES
✅ **Is Indigenous leadership framed as expertise/urgency, not exclusivity?** YES
✅ **Are all community types mentioned early and often?** YES
✅ **Is the benefit to ALL young people clear?** YES
✅ **Does Indigenous data sovereignty read as "gold standard" not "special treatment"?** YES

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review updated documents** — Check that the reframing feels natural and accurate
2. **Create visualizations** — Use [AI_VISUALIZATION_PROMPTS.md](AI_VISUALIZATION_PROMPTS.md) with Napkin.ai to create sector-wide visuals
3. **Test messaging** — Share with CALD/disability/LGBTQIA+ stakeholders to confirm they feel included
4. **Update other materials** — Apply same framing to website, presentations, stakeholder communications
