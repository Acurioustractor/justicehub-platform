Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out to share something we've been building with communities across Australia — and to invite Mindaroo to help us take it to the next level.

## What We've Built & Where It Came From

Over the past [timeframe], working directly with communities in Mount Isa, Alice Springs, and through connections with initiatives like Mountzy Yarns, we've been documenting something remarkable: **the intelligence that already exists in community-led youth justice programs**. Not theoretical models from universities, but working solutions developed by people who understand intergenerational trauma, cultural disconnection, and the structural racism that drives Indigenous young people into detention at 17 times the rate of their non-Indigenous peers.

This work comes from:
- **Direct community partnership:** Stories, programs, and cultural protocols developed WITH communities, not extracted FROM them
- **Lived experience:** My own background spans building programs, impact design, and frontline work across Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ youth justice contexts
- **Justice Reinvestment experience:** Collaborating with JR initiatives that have proven community-led models can dramatically reduce youth detention

**What we've created is JusticeHub** — a digital platform that's already live with:
- 38 stories and transcripts from youth justice practitioners
- 454 organizations mapped
- 521 programs catalogued
- Automatic syncing with community data sources like the Empathy Ledger
- Full admin system for community content management

**You can explore it now:** [deployed URL when ready]

This isn't a concept or a proposal for what we might build. **It's operational infrastructure**, ready to scale.

## The Open & Honest Approach

I want to be completely transparent about what we're asking for and why the numbers look the way they do.

### The Investment: $9.5M–$13.0M Over 3 Years (Level 2 - Recommended)

This is **seed capital for permanent community infrastructure**, not ongoing program funding. Here's the honest breakdown:

**26% → Communities ($2.7M):** Direct community compensation
- $180K per community across 3 years (6 communities initially)
- Not token stipends — consultant rates for Indigenous knowledge
- Covers infrastructure, knowledge holder fees, cultural protocols, content creation
- Communities control how funds are used

**38% → Staff ($3.95M):** Indigenous-majority team (12 FTE)
- Year 1: 4 Indigenous trainees learning tech, storytelling, platform management
- Year 2: Trainees become paid staff, reducing reliance on external contractors
- Year 3: Indigenous team leads platform development (20-26% cost reduction)
- By Year 5: All technical roles held by Indigenous staff

**9% → Platform ($970K):** Technical development & maintenance
- Year 1: Build core features
- Year 2: Community-requested enhancements
- Year 3: Maintenance only (costs drop significantly)
- Indigenous developers increasingly self-sufficient

**8% → Training ($825K):** Capacity building for 15-20 trainees
- Technical skills: Platform development, database management, security
- Cultural skills: Digital storytelling, content curation, cultural protocols
- Business skills: Revenue generation, partnership management
- Creates permanent Indigenous tech workforce

**11% → Operations ($1.14M):** Office, equipment, events, partnerships
- Community gathering expenses
- International learning delegations (NZ, Canada Indigenous programs)
- Partnership development with peak bodies

**9% → A Curious Tractor Organizational Capacity ($970K):**
- Project management, financial compliance, risk management
- This is a complex systems-change initiative requiring dedicated infrastructure
- ~11-12% overhead — ensures sustainable delivery for all partners
- Transparent about costs, not hidden in other categories

### Why These Numbers Matter

Traditional philanthropy often under-invests in **organizational capacity** and **proper community compensation**, then wonders why projects fail or relationships break down. We're being honest about what it takes to:
1. **Compensate communities fairly** for cultural intelligence (not extract it for free)
2. **Build sustainable infrastructure** (not scramble from grant to grant)
3. **Create real independence** (not perpetual dependency on funders)

## The Path to Independence & Community Ownership

This is **time-limited philanthropy creating permanent assets**. Here's the honest 7-year pathway:

### Years 1-3: Foundation (Your Investment)
- **Revenue:** $0 → $60K (1.5% self-sustaining)
- **Outcome:** Platform fully operational, 15-20 trained Indigenous staff
- **Transition:** Clear readiness assessment for community ownership

### Years 4-5: Transfer to Community Ownership
- **Revenue:** $150K → $400K (12-15% self-sustaining)
- **Legal Structure:** Platform transfers to community-governed Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation (ACCO)
- **Governance:** First Nations Advisory Council becomes Board
- **A Curious Tractor role shifts:** From owner to service provider (if needed)

### Years 6-7: Financial Self-Determination
- **Revenue:** $500K → $800K+ (35-40% self-sustaining)
- **Revenue sources:**
  - Training programs for youth justice sector ($200-300K)
  - Membership/licensing fees from government agencies ($150-250K)
  - Consulting services to funders seeking effective programs ($100-200K)
  - Grant writing support using platform evidence ($50-100K)
- **Investment Fund:** Revenue flows to Community Investment Fund, redistributed to participating communities
- **Independence:** Communities can refuse inappropriate funding — true self-determination

### The Honest Truth About Sustainability

Social enterprises take **7-10 years** to reach 50-70% self-sustaining. Anyone promising faster is either under-investing in quality or over-promising outcomes. We're being realistic: **35-40% self-sustaining by Year 7** is achievable and responsible. Communities will always need some philanthropic support for work that serves the public good — but they won't be dependent on any single funder to survive.

## Connection to Mindaroo's 0-5 Focus

While youth justice is our primary driver, this work creates critical **prevention infrastructure** that connects to early childhood:

1. **Intergenerational Trauma Prevention:**
   Supporting young people today prevents trauma transmission to their future children. When a 15-year-old learns cultural connection instead of experiencing detention trauma, their future children benefit.

2. **Longitudinal Evidence for 0-5 Programs:**
   The platform enables tracking: Which early childhood interventions prevent later justice involvement? Communities can document family programs that address 0-5 supports alongside youth justice work.

3. **Family-Centered Community Programs:**
   The best youth justice programs are holistic — they support whole families across the life course, including early childhood services, family strengthening, and parenting support.

4. **Prevention ROI:**
   Platform data enables cost-benefit analysis showing early intervention impact. If supporting families with 0-5 year-olds reduces youth justice involvement 10 years later, we can prove it.

**Important context:** This connection strengthens the strategic case and aligns with Mindaroo's priorities, but youth justice communities need this infrastructure **regardless of early childhood linkages**. The project stands on its own merit for the 17,000+ young people currently in Australia's youth justice system — the 0-5 connection is a strategic bonus, not the foundation.

## Why This Is Different From Everything Else You've Seen

Most proposals ask for funding to **deliver services**. We're asking for seed capital to **build community power**.

**Typical Model:**
→ External organization receives funding
→ Provides services to communities
→ Retains ownership, control, revenue
→ Communities remain dependent
→ When funding ends, services disappear

**JusticeHub Model:**
→ Mindaroo provides seed capital
→ Communities develop platform WITH Indigenous leadership
→ **Platform legally transfers to community ownership** (Year 5)
→ Communities control governance, decisions, revenue
→ When Mindaroo's investment ends, **platform continues forever**
→ Revenue flows to Community Investment Fund, redistributed to communities
→ **Communities gain economic self-determination**

Your investment doesn't disappear — it becomes permanent Indigenous-owned infrastructure generating ongoing value for communities. This is transformational philanthropy, not transactional funding.

## What We're Asking

### Immediate Next Steps:

**1. Workshop Co-Design Session**
We'd love to convene a **half-day workshop** with Mindaroo to:
- Walk through the live platform together
- Discuss community sovereignty principles and risk mitigation
- Co-design evaluation framework with clear decision gates
- Explore phased investment approach (if you want to start smaller)
- Connect this work to Mindaroo's early childhood priorities

**2. Community Partner Engagement**
This conversation opens opportunities to engage our emerging partners:
- **Mount Isa** — Justice Reinvestment site with proven outcomes
- **Mountzy Yarns** — Community storytelling initiative
- **Alice Springs** — Long-standing Indigenous-led programs
- Plus connections to Bourke, Moree, and Doomadgee communities

We see this workshop as the beginning of a **longer-term partnership discussion**, not a one-time pitch. There's real potential to align this work with Mindaroo's goals while ensuring communities lead.

### What We Can Offer in Return:

- **Transparency:** Quarterly reporting, open financials, community feedback
- **Risk mitigation:** Phased investment with clear decision gates
- **Independent evaluation:** Third-party assessment at 12 and 24 months
- **Replicability:** Model can scale nationally and influence government policy
- **Global influence:** International Indigenous communities seeking connection
- **Early childhood linkages:** Demonstrated pathways from 0-5 prevention to youth justice outcomes

## The Bottom Line

We've built the platform. Communities are ready. The opportunity is now.

The question isn't whether this should exist — **it already does**. The question is whether it gets the support to scale to its full potential: **community-owned, economically self-determining, and setting the global standard for Indigenous data sovereignty**.

Mindaroo's investment would create **permanent infrastructure** that outlives any single funder, serves communities for generations, and proves that community ownership isn't just rhetoric — it's achievable, sustainable, and transformational.

**Would you be open to exploring this through a co-design workshop?** I'm happy to work around your schedule and can bring community partners into the conversation as appropriate.

Looking forward to continuing this conversation.

With respect and optimism,
