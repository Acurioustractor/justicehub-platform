# Building Revolution in Shipping Containers: The Story of CONTAINED

## The Problem We Can't Unsee

Australia spends $1.1 million per child, per year to lock them up. The "success rate"? 15.5%. That means 84.5% of kids reoffend within 12 months of release.

Meanwhile, community programs succeed at 78% - and cost 95% less.

Every statistic represents a child whose future hangs in the balance. We can't unknow what we know about what works.

## What is CONTAINED?

CONTAINED is not another awareness campaign with sad statistics on posters. It's an immersive experience built from shipping containers - transformation chambers that make the invisible visible and the abstract tangible.

We didn't just design this. We *built* it. With our hands.

Nicholas personally constructed the majority of the rooms, wired the electronics that make fluorescent despair tangible, embedded technology that bridges experience to action. Benjamin followed paper trails that lead to kids in cages, transforming data into moral urgency.

## Why Shipping Containers?

Because metaphors matter.

Young people in Australia's justice system are literally contained - in cells, in systems, in cycles of harm. By creating physical spaces that embody this containment, we invite people to step inside the experience, to feel what we've learned, to understand what must change.

## The Revolution Happens at the Intersection

Revolution doesn't happen in boardrooms. It happens when builders, dreamers, and survivors converge at the intersection of:

- **Moral urgency** - We know this is wrong
- **Practical possibility** - We know what works
- **Evidence-based action** - We have the proof

CONTAINED bridges experience to policy, practice to transformation. It's infrastructure for change, not charity for problems.
