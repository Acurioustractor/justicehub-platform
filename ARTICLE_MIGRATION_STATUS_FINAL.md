Re-scrape the 8 articles with insufficient content using improved prompts that specifically extract full article body text.

### Priority 2: Import Images
1. Create image downloader script
2. Upload to storage
3. Update database with new URLs

### Priority 3: Content Quality
Some articles may need manual review to ensure complete content.

## 💡 Lessons Learned:

1. **Multi-provider fallback is essential** - Saved the migration when Anthropic credits ran out

**Live URL:** http://localhost:3003/stories

**Working Features:**
- ✅ Story browsing
- ✅ Category filtering
- ✅ Individual article pages
- ✅ Location tags
- ✅ Reading times
- ✅ Mobile responsive

**Missing:**
- ⏳ Featured images on cards

- ⏳ 1 article (DeadlyLabs)

## 📝 Recommendation:

**For the 8 articles needing fixes:**

Option A: **Manual Fix** (30-60 minutes)
- Visit each URL
- Copy full content
- Paste into database

Option B: **Improved Scraper** (need OpenAI credits)
- Create better prompts targeting article body
- Re-run scraper on just these 8 URLs

**For Images:**
- Need strategy: self-host vs. CDN vs. keep external URLs
- External URLs may break if old site changes

---

**Overall: HUGE SUCCESS!** 🎉

97% of articles are live and working. The multi-provider system worked brilliantly. Just need to polish the remaining 8 articles and add images.
