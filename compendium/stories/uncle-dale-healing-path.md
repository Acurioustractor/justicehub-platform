# Building a Healing Path: Uncle Dale's Vision

> A vision for cultural healing centres that transform youth justice through Country, culture, and care.

## Story Summary

Uncle Dale's vision for cultural healing centres represents a fundamentally different approach to youth justice — one grounded in Country, culture, and community care rather than detention and punishment. His blueprint shows what alternatives to detention could look like when designed by Traditional Owners rather than bureaucrats. JusticeHub exists to amplify and support visions like this.
