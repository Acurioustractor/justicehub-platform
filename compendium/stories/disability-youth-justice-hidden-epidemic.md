# The Hidden Epidemic: Disability in Australia's Youth Justice System

> Up to 4 in 5 young people in custody have a cognitive disability, mental health condition, or neurodevelopmental difference. Most arrive undiagnosed. Few receive appropriate support.

## Story Summary

Australia's youth justice system holds a secret it rarely confronts: the vast majority of children in detention live with disability. Research consistently shows that between 60-80% of young people in custody have cognitive impairments, intellectual disability, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), acquired brain injury, or severe mental health conditions. Many have multiple, overlapping disabilities. Most enter the system undiagnosed, navigate courts without understanding proceedings, and serve time in facilities ill-equipped to meet their needs.

This is not a story of bad kids making bad choices. It is a story of system failure—where schools, child protection, and health services miss early signs; where police encounter behaviour they interpret as defiance rather than disability; where courts proceed without ensuring comprehension; and where detention becomes the default response to unmet support needs.

The young people at the centre of this story have names, families, and potential. What they need is recognition, support, and pathways away from the justice system—not deeper entrenchment within it.

## The Scale: What the Data Tells Us

### National Statistics

**Disability Prevalence in Youth Detention:**

| Disability Type | Prevalence in Custody | General Population |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Intellectual Disability | 10-15% | 2-3% |
| Cognitive Impairment (incl. FASD) | 20-30% | 1-2% |
| Mental Health Conditions | 70-88% | 10-15% |
| Acquired Brain Injury | 15-30% | 2-3% |
| Multiple/Complex Needs | 60-80% | N/A |

*Sources: AIHW Youth Justice reports 2023-24; Young People in Custody Health Survey (NSW); Victorian Youth Parole Board data*

### The Indigenous Dimension

First Nations young people are significantly over-represented at every point where disability and justice intersect:

- **23x** more likely to be in detention than non-Indigenous youth
- **4-5x** more likely to have intellectual disability in custody
- **11%** of Aboriginal young people in Victorian custody registered with Disability Services (compared to ~2% general population)
- **87%** of Aboriginal women in custody have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional abuse

The absence of culturally validated disability screening tools means many Indigenous young people's needs go unrecognised until they reach detention.

### The FASD Crisis

Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) represents perhaps the most misunderstood and underdiagnosed condition in youth justice:

- Estimated **10-20%** of young people in detention may have FASD
- Only **2%** have formal diagnosis
- Characteristics include: impulsivity, difficulty learning from consequences, poor memory, suggestibility, communication challenges
- Behaviour is often misinterpreted as defiant, non-compliant, or manipulative
- Standard court processes and conditions are often incomprehensible to young people with FASD

## How Disability Becomes "Criminal Behaviour"

### The School-to-Justice Pipeline

For many young people with undiagnosed disability, the path to detention begins in the classroom:

> "Over half of all young people in custody had been previously suspended or expelled from school."
> — Victorian Youth Parole Board Annual Report

Children with unrecognised cognitive disabilities or neurodevelopmental differences (ADHD, autism spectrum) often struggle with:
- Following multi-step instructions
- Sitting still for extended periods
- Understanding abstract rules and consequences
- Managing emotional regulation
- Reading social cues from peers and authority figures

Rather than receiving assessment and support, these children are frequently labelled as "disruptive," "defiant," or "naughty." Suspensions and exclusions follow. Disengagement from education increases. Association with similarly marginalised peers becomes likely. Justice system contact becomes probable.

### Police Encounters: Disability Misread as Defiance

When police encounter young people with cognitive impairment or mental health crisis, behaviours are often misinterpreted:

| Actual Behaviour | How It May Be Interpreted |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Slow or confused response to questions | Evasion, dishonesty |
| Repetitive questioning or echolalia | Aggression, non-compliance |
| Sensory overwhelm (covering ears, rocking) | Drug influence, suspicious behaviour |
| Inability to provide consistent account | Lying, unreliability |
| Anxiety-driven flight response | Resisting arrest, guilt |
| Literal interpretation of language | Sarcasm, disrespect |

### Courts: Proceedings Without Comprehension

Research indicates that many young people with cognitive impairment cannot meaningfully participate in court processes:

- **34%** of people appearing before Local Court on criminal charges showed significant intellectual deficits (Hayes, NSW)
- Young people may agree to charges they don't understand
- Conditions of bail and orders may be incomprehensible
- Consequences of pleas are often poorly grasped
- Right to silence may be waived due to suggestibility

### Detention: Inappropriate Settings for Complex Needs

Youth detention facilities are rarely designed or staffed to meet the needs of young people with disability:

- Sensory environments (noise, lighting, crowding) trigger distress
- Rigid routines don't accommodate neurodevelopmental differences
- Behaviour management approaches assume capacity for self-regulation
- Medical and therapeutic services are limited
- Education is interrupted or inappropriate to learning needs
- Isolation/segregation is used in response to disability-related behaviour

## The Royal Commission Response: Progress and Gaps

The Disability Royal Commission (2019-2023) made specific recommendations regarding youth justice:

### Recommendation 8.4: Screening and Assessment

**What was recommended:**
Timely screening and expert assessment for cognitive disability within 14 days of custody or community order commencement.

**Government responses (as of 2025):**

| Jurisdiction | Response | Status |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| South Australia | Accept | **Completed** — CAIDS-Q screening tool in use |
| Victoria | Accept | In progress — 14-day screening protocol established |
| NSW | Accept in principle | In progress — acknowledges lack of culturally validated tools |
| Queensland | Accept in principle | In progress — Neurodevelopmental Disability Framework being implemented |
| NT | Accept in principle | In progress — Specialist Assessment Team undertakes psychometric assessments |
| WA | Accept in principle | In progress — service model development commenced |
| ACT | Accept in principle | In progress — TIRA tool used for reasonable adjustment needs |
| Tasmania | Accept in principle | In progress — reviewing Youth Justice Admissions policy |

**Key barrier identified across jurisdictions:** No nationally suitable, culturally appropriate disability screening tool exists that can be administered by community-based frontline staff.

## Personal Stories: Lived Experience at the Intersection

### Story 1: "Jake" — The Path from Unseen Disability to Unnecessary Detention

*(Identity protected — consent scope: EXTERNAL-LITE)*

> "He was always in trouble at school. Couldn't sit still. Couldn't follow instructions. The teachers said he was naughty, but nobody asked if something was wrong."
> — Jake's grandmother

Jake entered out-of-home care at age 9 after family breakdown. By 13, he had been suspended from three schools. Police first encountered him when he was found on the streets at night—he had left his placement because the noise of other children triggered sensory overwhelm he couldn't articulate.

The police saw a child breaking curfew conditions. They didn't see a child with undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability who couldn't process the complex rules of his placement.

His first court appearance lasted four minutes. Jake nodded when asked if he understood the charges. He didn't. The duty lawyer had met him moments before. No one requested a cognitive assessment.

By 16, Jake had accumulated multiple breaches of bail conditions he couldn't comprehend. He spent six months on remand awaiting trial for offences that diversion programs—had they been offered with appropriate support—might have addressed.

In detention, Jake was diagnosed with intellectual disability and autism. He received support for the first time. But the support came too late to prevent years of justice system entanglement that disability-appropriate early intervention might have avoided.

**LCAA Shift:** Listen → Action — if Jake's needs had been recognised at first school suspension, his trajectory might have been entirely different.

### Story 2: "Maya" — FASD, Fierce Loyalty, and Getting Caught

*(Identity protected — consent scope: EXTERNAL-LITE)*

Maya, 17, was charged as an accessory after her boyfriend committed an armed robbery. She hadn't participated in the offence—she had been in the car, unaware of his intentions—but when police questioned her, she confessed to involvement she didn't have.

Maya has FASD. Her cognitive profile includes significant suggestibility, poor memory for sequences of events, and difficulty distinguishing between her own actions and things she has been told. In police questioning, eager to please authority figures and confused by rapid-fire questions, she agreed with propositions that weren't true.

Her lawyer requested a cognitive assessment before trial. The court granted it. The assessment confirmed FASD with significant impairments in executive function and suggestibility. The psychologist's report explained that Maya's "confession" was likely compliance rather than truth.

The charges were withdrawn. But the months on bail, the stigma, the lost education—these couldn't be withdrawn. Maya now receives NDIS supports for the first time. She's completing Year 11 with adjusted learning support. She wants to work with animals.

Her case represents what happens when disability *is* recognised—charges withdrawn, appropriate support accessed, potential pathway restored. It also represents the rarity of such recognition.

### Story 3: "Tyrone" — From Care to Custody to Community Control

*(Identity protected — consent scope: EXTERNAL-LITE)*

Tyrone entered the child protection system at age 4. By 14, he had experienced 12 placement changes. He has an acquired brain injury from childhood abuse, ADHD, and post-traumatic stress disorder. None of these were formally diagnosed when he first came to police attention at 13.

His first offences were minor—shoplifting, criminal trespass. Each time, he received cautions. But without support to address underlying trauma and cognitive impairment, the behaviour continued. By 15, he was on bail with strict conditions he struggled to remember and comply with.

Breaches followed. Remand followed. Detention followed.

Now 18, Tyrone has spent more of his adolescence in custody than in the community. The NDIS has finally approved support coordination and therapeutic services. He's trying to finish school. But the transition from custody to community is precarious—housing instability, limited employment options, and the cognitive impacts of his brain injury make independent living challenging.

His story illustrates the "care-to-custody" pipeline that disproportionately affects young people with disability in out-of-home care.

## What Young People with Disability Need

Based on research evidence and lived experience, effective responses for young people with disability in contact with justice require:

### 1. Early Identification and Assessment

- **Universal screening** at first point of contact (schools, child protection, police)
- **Culturally validated tools** for Indigenous young people
- **Assessment by qualified professionals** with youth justice expertise
- **Information sharing** between health, education, and justice systems

### 2. Diversion with Appropriate Support

- **Specialist courts** (cognitive impairment, mental health, Indigenous)
- **Intensive case management** with disability expertise
- **Supported accommodation** as alternative to remand
- **Culturally safe programs** for Indigenous young people

### 3. Therapeutic Approaches in Detention

- **Sensory-friendly environments**
- **Communication support** (visual aids, plain language)
- **Trauma-informed care**
- **Continuity of NDIS and disability services**
- **Individualised education plans**

### 4. Transition Support

- **Disability-aware throughcare** from custody to community
- **Stable housing** with support
- **Education and employment pathways** adapted to cognitive needs
- **Long-term NDIS coordination**

## Systemic Changes Required

### From the Disability Royal Commission

**Recommendation 8.13:** Screen and assess for cognitive disability within 14 days
- Status: Partially implemented across jurisdictions
- Gap: No national, culturally appropriate screening tool

**Recommendation 8.14:** Ensure appropriate therapeutic responses
- Status: In progress
- Gap: Capacity varies significantly across jurisdictions

**Recommendation 8.15:** Address over-representation of children in out-of-home care
- Status: Limited progress
- Gap: Care-criminalisation pipeline continues

### Additional Priorities

1. **Mandatory training** for police, lawyers, magistrates on recognising cognitive impairment
2. **Independent support persons** for all young people with suspected disability in police questioning
3. **Restorative justice options** adapted for cognitive impairment
4. **National consistency** in disability screening and support approaches
5. **Data collection** on disability in justice—currently patchy and inconsistent

## Conclusion: Justice Requires Recognition

Australia cannot claim to have a just youth justice system while the majority of children in detention have unmet disability support needs. Recognition—early, accurate, culturally safe—is the foundation of appropriate response.

The young people whose stories appear here are not criminals who happen to have disabilities. They are children with disabilities who have been failed by systems that should have supported them. The justice system becomes involved not because they are uniquely criminal, but because other systems—education, health, child protection—failed to see, assess, and respond to their needs.

Transforming this reality requires:
- Investment in early identification
- Diversion that actually diverts
- Detention environments that don't cause harm
- Transition support that enables genuine community reintegration

The data exists. The research is clear. The stories have been told. What remains is action.
