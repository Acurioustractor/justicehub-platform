# Brodie Germaine: System Change Advocacy

> Translating lived experience into policy influence and systemic reform.

## Story Summary

Beyond personal transformation, Brodie's work demonstrates how lived experience can drive system-level change. His advocacy has influenced policy conversations around youth detention alternatives, and his story is used (with his consent) to make the case that community-led approaches work. This vignette shows JusticeHub's ultimate goal: not just connecting youth to services, but changing the systems that failed them.
