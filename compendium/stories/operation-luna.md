# Operation Luna Success

> A community-led response contributed to a major reduction in youth offending.

## Story Summary

Operation Luna demonstrated what happens when community-led approaches replace punitive responses: a 72% reduction in youth offending, 85% school return rate, and dramatically reduced case management burden. This is JusticeHub's strongest quantitative evidence that community authority works. The data is not extracted — it is shared by the community program team to make the case for scaling what works.
