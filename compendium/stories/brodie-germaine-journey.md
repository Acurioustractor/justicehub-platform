# Brodie Germaine's Journey

> From housing commission kid to national advocate — transformation through connection.

## Story Summary

Brodie's journey from housing commission childhood through the justice system to becoming a national advocate for youth justice reform is one of the most powerful demonstrations of what community-led support can achieve. His story grounds JusticeHub's approach: lived experience is not a credential to extract — it is leadership to support. Brodie's advocacy work now shapes policy conversations and demonstrates that the people closest to the problem are closest to the solution.
