# Jesús Teruel — Diagrama Foundation

> A respect-centred approach to youth rehabilitation and reintegration.

## Story Summary

Jesús Teruel's work at Diagrama Foundation in Spain offers JusticeHub a live international reference for humane justice practice. The respect-centred approach to youth rehabilitation demonstrates that alternatives to punitive detention are not theoretical — they are working, at scale, in another country. This international evidence strengthens the case for reform in Australia.
