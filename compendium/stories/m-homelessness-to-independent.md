# M: From Homelessness to Independent Living

> With Oonchiumpa support, M and her mother secured stable housing and M gained her own income.

## Story Summary

M's journey from homelessness to independent living — supported by Oonchiumpa's community-led approach — shows what sustained, relationship-based support achieves. Both M and her mother secured stable housing, and M gained her own income. This is the kind of outcome that JusticeHub exists to document and amplify: measurable change through community authority, not institutional control.
