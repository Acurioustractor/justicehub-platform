# The Origin of A Curious Tractor

> Technology should cultivate community growth, not extract value.

## Story Summary

JusticeHub was born from the same philosophy as all ACT projects: technology should work like a tractor's power take-off — powerful, repairable, transferable. The justice platform was built so communities could own their own justice infrastructure, not depend on external systems. This vignette connects JusticeHub's technical choices to ACT's founding belief that tools should be designed for handover.
