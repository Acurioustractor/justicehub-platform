# A: From Guarded to Self-Advocate

> A young person moved from guarded disengagement to naming needs and seeking support.

## Story Summary

Through sustained community support via Oonchiumpa, a young person who was initially guarded and disengaged learned to articulate their own needs and advocate for themselves. This transformation — from silence to self-advocacy — demonstrates the justice reform approach that JusticeHub documents and amplifies: change happens through relationship, not coercion.
