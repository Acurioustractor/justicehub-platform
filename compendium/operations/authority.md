# JusticeHub — Authority & Consent

## Authority Check

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Who holds authority?** | Community justice practitioners and lived experience advisors |
| **How do we know?** | Partnership agreements with Oonchiumpa, Diagrama, MMEIC. Lived experience advisory input. |
| **Consent in place?** | Case studies shared with explicit organisational consent. Individual stories identity-protected. |
| **Handover plan?** | Open-source platform designed for community ownership. Governance structure in development. |

## Consent Framework

- **Research content:** Indexed from public sources. AI research chat uses published evidence.
- **Service directory:** Organisations control their own listings.
- **Story vignettes:** Shared via Empathy Ledger with explicit consent scope per story.
- **Identity protection:** All youth stories use pseudonyms or initials. No identifying details.
- **Partner data:** Each partner organisation controls what they share and how it's used.

## ALMA Compliance

Every piece of evidence in JusticeHub is tagged with ALMA signals:
- **Evidence Strength:** How well-supported is this claim?
- **Community Authority:** Who holds authority over this knowledge?
- **Harm Risk:** Could sharing this cause harm?
- **Implementation Capability:** Can this be acted on?
- **Option Value:** Does this open new possibilities?
- **Community Value Return:** How much flows back to community?

## Cultural Safety

1. Youth are never described as "offenders" — system-impacted language used throughout
2. Indigenous-led programs centred, not tokenised
3. International comparisons presented as learning, not prescription
4. Community authority carries highest weight in platform decisions
