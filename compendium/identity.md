# JusticeHub — Identity

> Justice infrastructure centred on community authority and local solutions.

## Purpose

JusticeHub exists to centre lived experience in youth justice reform. The platform connects research, evidence, and service directories to the people who actually know what works — communities, practitioners, and young people themselves. It is not a case management tool. It is infrastructure that communities can own, adapt, and use to advocate for alternatives to detention.

## Philosophy Alignment

| Principle | How It Shows Up |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Community authority comes first** | Lived-experience advisors shape platform direction. Community organisations control their data. |
| **Evidence is story, not surveillance** | Research hub indexes evidence without profiling individuals. Stories carry context. |
| **Build for handover** | Open-source platform. Designed for community ownership. |
| **Make with lived experience** | Pathways for lived-experience leadership in justice advocacy. |
| **Identity before product** | We start with who holds authority in justice spaces, then build tools around that. |

## LCAA in Practice

| Stage | How It Manifests |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Listen** | AI research chat surfaces community voice alongside policy evidence. Service directory built from community knowledge. |
| **Curiosity** | International comparisons (Diagrama, Spain). Inquiry database indexes what's been tried. |
| **Action** | Contained art installation brings justice reform into public consciousness. Service directory connects youth to support. |
| **Art** | Contained exhibitions make system change felt, not abstract. Network visualisations reveal hidden connections. |

## Brand Voice

- Evidence-based but community-led
- "Justice infrastructure" not "justice tech"
- Centre young people's agency, not their trauma
- Never describe young people as "offenders" — they are system-impacted
- Lead with what works, not what's broken

## What Makes This Different

Most justice platforms are built for the system. JusticeHub is built for the communities the system impacts. The research hub doesn't just index policy — it foregrounds lived experience evidence. The service directory doesn't just list providers — it maps networks of community support. The Contained program doesn't just advocate — it makes the case for change through art and direct experience.
