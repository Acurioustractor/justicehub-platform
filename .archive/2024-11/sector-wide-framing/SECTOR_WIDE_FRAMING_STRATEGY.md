# Sector-Wide Framing Strategy for JusticeHub

**Issue:** Current pitch may read as "Indigenous-only" when it should be "whole-of-sector with Indigenous leadership"

**Goal:** Position JusticeHub as serving ALL young people in youth justice, with Indigenous data sovereignty as the gold standard framework that protects everyone.

---

## 🎯 The Reframe

### **CURRENT FRAMING (Too Narrow):**
"JusticeHub is a community-owned digital intelligence platform for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people in youth justice..."

### **IMPROVED FRAMING (Sector-Wide):**
"JusticeHub is a community-owned digital intelligence platform for **all young people** in the youth justice system. Because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are **17 times overrepresented** in detention, Indigenous communities lead the platform design and their data sovereignty framework becomes the **gold standard** that protects everyone—Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike."

---

## 📊 The Problem with Current Positioning

**What we're currently doing:**
- Leading with Indigenous overrepresentation stats ✅
- Emphasizing Indigenous data sovereignty ✅
- Mentioning CALD/disability/LGBTQIA+ as "also included" ❌

**How it reads:**
- "This is an Indigenous program that also happens to include others"
- Indigenous young people are the primary beneficiaries
- Other communities are secondary

**What we should be doing:**
- Position as **whole-of-sector platform**
- Indigenous leadership is because of overrepresentation, not exclusivity
- Indigenous data sovereignty protects **everyone** (best practice)
- All young people benefit equally

---

## ✅ Recommended Language Changes

### **1. Opening/Problem Statement**

**CURRENT:**
> "Detention statistics tell a clear story—especially for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, who are dramatically over-represented..."

**IMPROVED:**
> "**Every young person** in Australia's youth justice system deserves better. But the crisis is most acute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people—**17 times more likely** to be in detention than their non-Indigenous peers. The knowledge to change this exists in communities across Australia—Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities—but it stays local, uncompensated, and invisible to the broader sector."

**Why better:**
- Opens with "every young person" (universal)
- Indigenous overrepresentation as evidence of urgency (not exclusivity)
- Explicitly names all communities upfront
- Framed as sector-wide knowledge problem

---

### **2. Solution Statement**

**CURRENT:**
> "While the platform is deliberately framed around First Nations leadership—because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people remain drastically over-represented..."

**IMPROVED:**
> "JusticeHub is deliberately architected under **Indigenous leadership** for three reasons:
>
> 1. **Statistical urgency** — Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are 17x overrepresented in detention
> 2. **Knowledge sovereignty** — Indigenous communities have pioneered data sovereignty frameworks that protect everyone
> 3. **Sector gold standard** — If we get Indigenous data sovereignty right, we protect all young people
>
> The platform serves **all communities** working in youth justice—Indigenous, CALD, remote non-Indigenous, disability, LGBTQIA+—with Indigenous governance ensuring the highest standards of consent, cultural safety, and community control for everyone."

**Why better:**
- Clear, numbered rationale for Indigenous leadership
- Framed as "gold standard" not "special treatment"
- Explicit that platform serves everyone
- Indigenous governance = protection for all

### **3. Who It's For Section** (NEW - ADD THIS)

**NEW SECTION TO ADD:**

> ### WHO JUSTICEHUB SERVES
>
> **Primary Beneficiaries:** All young people in Australia's youth justice system
>
> **Communities We Engage:**
> - **Indigenous communities** (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) — Leading platform design, setting sovereignty standards
> - **CALD communities** (Culturally and Linguistically Diverse) — African Australian, Pasifika, Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern young people and families
> - **Remote non-Indigenous communities** — Regional and remote towns with limited service access
> - **Disability communities** — Young people with cognitive, physical, mental health disabilities
> - **LGBTQIA+ communities** — Gender diverse and sexuality diverse young people in youth justice
> - **Mainstream services** — Government, NGO, and community practitioners serving all of the above
>
> **Why Indigenous Leadership?**
>
> Not because the platform is only for Indigenous young people—it's not. But because:
> 1. Indigenous young people face the most acute crisis (17x overrepresentation)
> 2. Indigenous communities have developed the most sophisticated consent and sovereignty frameworks
> 3. If we build to Indigenous data sovereignty standards, we protect everyone
>
> Indigenous leadership = sector best practice, not exclusivity.

---

### **4. Impact Statement**

**CURRENT:**
> "For Young People: Services based on what works, pathways from recipients to platform developers and leaders"

**IMPROVED:**
> **For All Young People:**
> - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people get culturally safe, healing-centered approaches proven in community
> - CALD young people get services that respect their cultural backgrounds and family structures
> - Young people with disabilities get trauma-informed care tailored to their needs
> - LGBTQIA+ young people get affirming support from practitioners who understand their experiences
> - ALL young people benefit from evidence-based practice, not punishment-based systems
>
> **Pathways:** Young people from all backgrounds become platform contributors, developers, storytellers, and leaders—not just service recipients.

---

### **5. Community Payment Model**

**CURRENT:**
> "Communities paid fairly to share their knowledge"

**IMPROVED:**
> **Fair Compensation for All Communities:**
>
> Whether Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, or LGBTQIA+ communities:
> - **Partnership fees:** $80K per community per year (not token stipends)
> - **Knowledge holder payments:** $200/hour for Elders, cultural practitioners, program experts
> - **Content bounties:** $2,500 per video, $1,000 per program documentation
>
> We value knowledge from ALL communities at consultant rates, not charity rates.
>
> **Why start with 6 Indigenous communities in Year 1?**
> - Highest statistical need (17x overrepresentation)
> - Strongest existing relationships (Bourke, Moree, Alice Springs)
> - Data sovereignty frameworks most developed
> - Other communities join Years 2-3 as capacity scales

## 📋 Key Messaging Points (Across All Documents)

### **Always Say:**

1. ✅ "Platform serves **all young people** in youth justice"
2. ✅ "Indigenous communities **lead** because of overrepresentation and sovereignty expertise"
3. ✅ "Indigenous data sovereignty framework protects **everyone**"
4. ✅ "Engaging Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, LGBTQIA+ communities"
5. ✅ "Best practice for Indigenous young people = best practice for all young people"

### **Never Say:**

1. ❌ "Platform for Indigenous young people"
2. ❌ "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander focus"
3. ❌ "Other communities also included" (implies they're secondary)
4. ❌ "Indigenous-specific platform"
5. ❌ Language that makes non-Indigenous communities feel like afterthoughts

## 🎯 Revised Core Narrative (1 Paragraph)

**USE THIS AS THE NEW STANDARD:**

> JusticeHub is a community-owned digital intelligence platform serving **all young people** in Australia's youth justice system. The platform is built under **Indigenous leadership** for three reasons: (1) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are 17 times more likely to be in detention, making this the sector's most urgent crisis; (2) Indigenous communities have pioneered data sovereignty frameworks that set the gold standard for consent and community control; and (3) if we build infrastructure that protects Indigenous knowledge properly, we protect everyone. The platform engages Indigenous, CALD, remote, disability, and LGBTQIA+ communities, compensating all fairly ($180K per community annually) and ensuring their knowledge drives sector reform. This isn't an Indigenous program—it's a **sector-wide platform** built to Indigenous sovereignty standards, benefiting every young person in the system.

## 📊 Statistics to Use (Reframed)

### **Youth Justice Crisis (Whole Sector):**

**Overall:**
- 4,400+ young people detained on an average night in Australia
- 75% have experienced trauma
- 50%+ have cognitive impairments or disabilities
- 60%+ are from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds

**Indigenous Young People (Most Acute):**
- **17x more likely** to be in detention than non-Indigenous peers
- Represent 50%+ of detained young people (but 6% of population)
- Average detention cost: $1,500 per day per young person

**CALD Young People:**
- Pacific Islander young people overrepresented in NSW, QLD, VIC
- African Australian young people overrepresented in VIC, WA
- Often face language barriers, cultural misunderstanding in services

**Other Overrepresented Groups:**
- Young people with disabilities: 70-80% of youth justice cohort
- LGBTQIA+ young people: 2-3x higher rates than cisgender/heterosexual peers
- Young people in out-of-home care: Significant overrepresentation

**Message:** This is a crisis affecting multiple communities. Indigenous young people face the most acute crisis, hence Indigenous leadership. But we're serving everyone.
