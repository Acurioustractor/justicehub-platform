# Mount Isa Aunties - JusticeHub Platform Strategy
## Multi-Layered Content Implementation Plan

---

## TL;DR: It Should Live Everywhere

The Mount Isa Aunties material is too valuable to exist in just one place. This content should be:

1. ✅ **A Community Program** (primary hub for all related content)
2. ✅ **Public Profiles** (Aunty Corrine + others who consent)
3. ✅ **Multiple Stories** (interview, practice story, multimedia)
4. ✅ **Research/Case Study** (Centre of Excellence)
5. ✅ **Blog Post** (SEO/discoverability gateway)

**Why multi-layered?**
- Different audiences discover content different ways
- Platform auto-linking creates rich knowledge web
- Maximizes impact for grant applications, media, advocacy
- Honors the depth and breadth of Aunties' expertise

---

## RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION: Phase-by-Phase

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Do This First) - January 2025**

#### **1.1 Create Community Program Entry**

**Location:** `/community-programs/mount-isa-aunties-network`

**Content:**
```markdown
# Mount Isa Aunties Network

## Overview
Community-led youth and family support network in Mount Isa, Queensland, providing cross-system navigation, cultural authority, and advocacy for young people and families involved with police, courts, child protection, housing, and mental health systems.

## What They Do
- Unpaid cross-system case coordination (police, child protection, housing, courts, mental health, education)
- Cultural mentoring and Elder authority
- Crisis intervention and emergency accommodation
- Advocacy at hospitals, courts, watch houses, schools
- Family finding and reunification
- Clothing, food, transport support
- Community education about service gaps and funding

## Who They Serve
- Young people aged 10-25 involved with or at risk of justice system involvement
- Families in crisis across multiple systems
- Young people transitioning from Cleveland Youth Detention Centre
- Community members navigating housing, child protection, mental health services

## Geographic Focus
Mount Isa, North West Queensland (also support extended family in Townsville, Doomadgee, surrounding communities)

## Approach
- Aboriginal-led with Elder governance
- Relationship-based, not program-based
- Addresses root causes: housing, family, education, health, culture
- Advocacy-oriented: challenges system failures publicly
- Unpaid community expertise (currently seeking funding for infrastructure and compensation)

## Evidence of Impact
- 25+ young people "taken on" by network over 20 years
- Multiple successful advocacy outcomes (police accountability, service provider changes, child protection interventions)
- High trust with young people and families (police bring people to Aunties during crises)
- Systems navigation expertise across 10+ government departments/agencies
- International recognition: Featured in ABC Four Corners, community consultations

## Key People
- Aunty Corrine (primary profile)
- Aunty Sondra Ah Wing
- [Other Aunties with consent]

## Current Status
Seeking funding for:
- Compensation for expertise currently provided unpaid
- JusticeHub platform deployment for community-owned knowledge infrastructure
- Legal protection and advocacy support
- Connection to national network of community advocates
- Long-term investment (10+ years) in community infrastructure

## Tags
Indigenous-led, Elder-led, Community-controlled, Cross-system-navigation, Youth-justice, Child-protection, Housing-advocacy, Queensland, Remote-community, Unpaid-labor, Community-expertise

## Related Programs
- Bourke Maranguka Justice Reinvestment (NSW)
- NSW Youth Koori Court
- Just Reinvest NSW - Moree
- BackTrack Youth Works
```

**Why this first:**
- Creates the "hub" that everything else links to
- Appears on interactive map (Mount Isa as location)
- Searchable/filterable by tags
- Foundation for profiles and stories

---

#### **1.2 Create Public Profile: Aunty Corrine**

**Location:** `/people/aunty-corrine`

**Content:**
```markdown
# Aunty Corrine

## Role
Community Leader, Youth & Family Advocate, Systems Navigator

## Location
Mount Isa, Queensland

## Bio
Aunty Corrine has spent 20+ years providing unpaid cross-system navigation and advocacy for young people and families in Mount Isa. She has taken 5 police officers to court for misconduct (winning every case), coordinated care across police, child protection, housing, mental health, and education systems for 25+ young people, and publicly challenged service providers and government agencies for failing to support community.

Aunty Corrine is recognized by professionals (counselors, doctors, social workers) as an expert systems navigator, yet receives no compensation for expertise that would cost $800-1,200/day if billed at professional rates.

## Expertise
- Cross-system navigation (police, courts, child protection, housing, mental health, education)
- Youth justice advocacy
- Elder authority and cultural mentoring
- Cleveland Youth Detention Centre family support
- Housing policy and homelessness intervention
- Crisis de-escalation and family reunification
- Service provider accountability
- Public advocacy and media engagement

## Associated Programs
- Mount Isa Aunties Network

## Stories
- [Link to interview story]
- [Link to "You're Our Paycheck" blog post]
- [Link to multimedia story when created]

## Media/Recognition
- ABC Four Corners (Cleveland Youth Detention Centre investigation)
- Community consultations with Queensland Government
- [Other media as documented]

## Quote
"I got the voice but I got no backup. That's why I wanted you to come here...Every meeting I go to I always say that and a lot of people say, 'Oh, you need to stop running your mouth or you're gonna get in trouble.' I say, 'I don't care because it's our children that miss out.'"

## Tags
Elder, Community-leader, Lived-experience, Indigenous, Youth-justice-expert, Advocate, Queensland

## Privacy Settings
Public (with Aunty Corrine's consent)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Honors Aunty as expert, not just "community member"
- Creates permanent record of her expertise
- Links to all related content
- Can be cited in grant applications, research

---

#### **1.3 Create Initial Story: Interview**

**Location:** `/stories/aunty-corrine-mount-isa-interview`

**Type:** Interview Story

**Content:**
Use the blog draft ([BLOG_DRAFT_AUNTY_CORRINE.md](BLOG_DRAFT_AUNTY_CORRINE.md)) with some adaptations:

- Add **interview Q&A format** alongside narrative sections
- Include **photo** of Aunty Corrine (if consented)
- Embed **direct audio clips** (if recorded and consented)
- Add **related links** to programs, research, other stories
- Tag comprehensively for discoverability

**Sections:**
1. Introduction: "I got the voice but I got no backup"
2. The Work: Cross-system navigation
3. The Economics: "You're our paycheck"
4. Cleveland: Black box of harm
5. What Works (and what doesn't): VOP, CASH, Army pathways
6. The Backup Needed
7. Call to Action

**Why interview format:**
- Preserves Aunty's voice and authority
- Feels collaborative, not extractive
- Can be updated with additional conversations
- Aligns with other JusticeHub interview stories

---

## WHY THIS MULTI-LAYERED APPROACH WORKS

### **1. Different Audiences, Different Entry Points**

| Audience | Entry Point | Journey |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Media (ABC, Guardian)** | Blog post (SEO) | → Story → Program → Contact |
| **Funders (Mindaroo, NSW Govt)** | Research case study | → Program → Evidence → Funding ask |
| **Other Communities** | Program page (map) | → Stories → "How do we do this?" |
| **Policymakers** | Centre of Excellence | → Research → International comparison |
| **General Public** | Social media video | → Blog → Stories → Support |
| **Researchers** | Search/tags | → Case study → Related programs |

### **2. Platform Auto-Linking Creates Knowledge Web**

Every piece of content **automatically links** to related content:
- Stories show "Related Programs"
- Programs show "Key People"
- Profiles show "Associated Programs" and "Stories"
- Research shows "Related Case Studies"
- Tags connect across content types

**User flow example:**
1. Find blog post via Google ("Mount Isa youth justice")
2. Click through to Aunty Corrine's profile
3. Discover Mount Isa Aunties Network program
4. See related programs (Bourke, Moree)
5. Explore Centre of Excellence case studies
6. Watch video series
7. **Result:** Deep understanding, not just one article

### **3. Maximizes Impact for Multiple Goals**

| Goal | How Multi-Layer Helps |
|------|----------------------|
| **Grant applications** | Research case study = evidence; Program page = proof of concept |
| **Media coverage** | Blog post = shareable; Video = TV-ready; Interview = quotes |
| **Community recognition** | Profile = honors expertise; Program page = validates work |
| **Advocacy** | Multiple entry points to same story = harder to ignore |
| **Fundraising** | Program page = clear ask; Evidence = credibility |
| **Network building** | Related programs = connections; Tags = discovery |

### **4. Honors Complexity of Aunties' Work**

A single blog post can't capture:
- 20+ years of expertise
- Cross-system navigation complexity
- Economic analysis
- Cleveland stories
- What works / what doesn't
- Connection to international evidence
- Advocacy and public challenges
- Relationship to broader movement

**Multi-layered approach allows:**
- Deep dive for those who want it
- Quick overview for those who need it
- Video for visual learners
- Text for researchers
- Data for funders
- Stories for media

---

## PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### **Step 1: Get Consent (Week 1)**

**What you need from Aunty Corrine:**
- [ ] Approval of blog post content
- [ ] Permission to use name, story, quotes publicly
- [ ] Photo for profile (if available/consented)
- [ ] Any edits or removals to draft content
- [ ] Interest in being recorded for video (future)

**Send her:**
- Draft blog post
- Explanation of where content will appear (program, profile, story, blog)
- Confirm she can review everything before it's public
- Explain she owns her story and can update/remove anytime

---

### **Step 2: Create Foundation Content (Week 2-3)**

**Technical implementation:**

1. **Create Program Entry**
   - File: `app/routes/community-programs.mount-isa-aunties-network/route.tsx`
   - Database: Insert into `programs` table with location, tags, description
   - Link to Empathy Ledger if applicable

2. **Create Profile**
   - File: `app/routes/people.aunty-corrine/route.tsx`
   - Database: Insert into `people` table with role, location, bio
   - Privacy settings: Public (with consent)

3. **Create Interview Story**
   - File: `app/routes/stories.aunty-corrine-mount-isa-interview/route.tsx`
   - Use blog draft as base, adapt to interview format
   - Add Q&A sections, photos, tags
   - Link to program and profile

4. **Create Blog Post**
   - File: `app/routes/blog.youre-our-paycheck-mount-isa-aunties/route.tsx`
   - Optimize for SEO
   - Include social media meta tags
   - Call to action linking to deeper content

**Auto-linking:**
- Platform will automatically create "Related Content" sections
- Geographic tagging (Mount Isa, QLD) links to map
- Role tags (Elder, Community-leader) enable filtering

---

### **Step 3: Publish & Promote (Week 4)**

**Publication order:**
1. Program page (foundational hub)
2. Profile (establishes Aunty as expert)
3. Interview story (rich content)
4. Blog post (gateway for discovery)

**Promotion:**
1. **Email newsletter** to JusticeHub subscribers
2. **Social media** (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook)
   - Pull quotes with images
   - Video clips if available
   - Link to blog post
3. **Media outreach**
   - ABC (already have relationship via Four Corners)
   - Guardian Australia
   - NITV
   - Queensland-focused outlets
4. **Direct sharing**
   - Send to Bourke, Moree, Alice Springs communities
   - Share with Mindaroo Foundation
   - Include in NSW grant application

---

### **Step 4: Add Research Layer (Month 2)**

**Create case study for Centre of Excellence:**
- Use [MOUNT_ISA_AUNTIES_ANALYSIS.md](MOUNT_ISA_AUNTIES_ANALYSIS.md) as source
- Add economic analysis
- Compare to NSW Youth Koori Court, Bourke Maranguka
- Include international benchmarks
- Publish with program/profile links

**Why later:**
- Builds on foundation content
- Can incorporate any media coverage
- Time to gather additional evidence if needed

---

### **Step 5: Multimedia Expansion (Month 3-6)**

**If you return to Mount Isa or arrange remote recording:**
- Conduct video interviews
- Create 5-episode series
- Publish on JusticeHub + YouTube
- Embed in existing stories/program page

**Why later:**
- Foundation content already live and working
- Can promote videos using existing audience
- Time to plan video production properly

---

## CONTENT OWNERSHIP & CONSENT

### **Critical Principles:**

1. **Aunty Corrine owns her story**
   - She can request changes anytime
   - She can request removal anytime
   - No content published without explicit consent

2. **Aboriginal Data Sovereignty**
   - JusticeHub platform documents community knowledge
   - Community controls how it's used
   - Not extracted for government/research without permission

3. **Empathy Ledger Integration**
   - If Aunty consents, story can sync to Empathy Ledger
   - Creates permanent record under community control
   - Enables data sharing across trusted communities

4. **Attribution & Compensation**
   - Aunty credited as expert, not just "community member"
   - Platform builds case for funding her work
   - If JusticeHub generates revenue from this content (e.g., training), Aunty should be compensated

---

---

## WHAT THIS ENABLES FOR NSW GRANT & MINDAROO PROPOSAL

### **For NSW Grant Application (Due January 2026):**

**You can now include:**
1. **Program page link** - "This is what community-led looks like"
2. **Research case study** - Evidence of unpaid expertise and economic value
3. **Stories** - First-person voices from community
4. **Comparison** - Mount Isa alongside Bourke, NSW Youth Koori Court
5. **Call for funding** - Compensate existing expertise, don't replicate with services

**In application sections:**
- "Demonstrated understanding of local community needs" → Link to program page
- "Evidence of consultation with target group" → Aunties govern, not consult
- "Sustainability plan" → JusticeHub infrastructure for community ownership

---

### **For Mindaroo Proposal:**

**You can now demonstrate:**
1. **Proof of concept** - Mount Isa Aunties are the model
2. **Platform capability** - Multi-layered content architecture working
3. **Community ownership** - Aunties' knowledge documented, they control it
4. **Scalability** - Same model for 10 communities ($180K each)
5. **Impact measurement** - Metrics from actual implementation

**Mindaroo cares about:**
- ✅ Community agency (Aunties own their content)
- ✅ Systemic change (challenging extraction model)
- ✅ Innovation (multi-layered knowledge infrastructure)
- ✅ Evidence (research case study + lived experience)
- ✅ Sustainability (platform infrastructure, not programs)

---

---

## THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION

**"Where does this sit as a blog / reflection / research etc?"**

**Answer: It sits in ALL of these places, because that's how you honor the depth and maximize the impact.**

- **Blog** = Gateway for discovery (SEO, media, social)
- **Story** = Aunty's voice and lived experience
- **Research** = Evidence for funders and policymakers
- **Program** = Practical model for replication
- **Profile** = Recognition of expertise
- **Video** = Accessible, shareable, preserves voice

**This isn't "a blog post about Aunty Corrine."**

**This is documenting and platforming a 20+ year model of community expertise that should be funded, replicated, and connected nationally.**

**The multi-layered approach makes that possible.**

---

**Next step: Send the blog draft to Aunty Corrine for approval, then implement Phase 1.**

Let me know if you want me to help with the technical implementation (creating the actual routes/database entries) or refining any of the content!
