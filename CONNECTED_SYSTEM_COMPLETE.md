### Linking Stories to Programs

**Method 1: SQL Update (Now)**
```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor:

-- First, get the program ID:
SELECT id, name FROM community_programs WHERE name LIKE '%CAMPFIRE%';

-- Then link the story:
UPDATE articles
SET program_id = '<campfire-uuid>'
WHERE slug = 'your-story-slug';
```

**Method 2: Web Form (Future)**
When we build the story editor, you'll select programs from a dropdown.

## What This Enables

### For Visitors
- **Discover programs through stories** they connect with
- **Find more stories** from programs they're interested in
- **Navigate seamlessly** between related content
- **Understand context** - see the full picture

### For You
- **Add programs easily** via web form (no technical skills)
- **Build connections** naturally as content grows
- **Track impact** with story counts per program
- **Scale organically** - each addition increases value

### The Network Effect
```
6 programs + 0 stories = 6 connection points
6 programs + 18 stories = 24+ connection points
20 programs + 60 stories = 80+ connection points
100 programs + 300 stories = 400+ connection points
```

Every addition multiplies discovery paths.
