## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Verification system**: Comprehensive, actionable, immediately useful
2. **Strategic documentation**: Clear plans beat ad-hoc execution
3. **Priority tiers**: Focus on high-impact services first
4. **Multiple enrichment methods**: No single solution works for all
5. **Partnership templates**: Professional, comprehensive, ready to use

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Google blocking**: Automated searches flagged (need API instead)
2. **RLS policies**: Required SQL approach for bulk imports
3. **Limited public data**: QLD Open Data not as useful as hoped
4. **Model deprecation**: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 end-of-life notice
5. **Extraction accuracy**: Only captured ~45% of providers on first pass

### Recommendations
1. **Use APIs**: Avoid scraping when APIs available
2. **Tier prioritization**: High-value services first
3. **SQL for bulk**: Bypass RLS for large imports
4. **Multiple methods**: Combine automated + manual
5. **Document everything**: Future you will thank present you
