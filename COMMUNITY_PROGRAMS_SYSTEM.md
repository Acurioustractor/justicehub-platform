# üåü Community Programs System - Complete Guide

## üìñ Overview

This guide explains how community programs are stored and how you can add programs based on your experiences around Australia.

---

## üéØ Current Status: HARDCODED ‚Üí READY TO MIGRATE

### **How Programs Are Currently Stored:**

Programs are **hardcoded** in two TypeScript files:
1. `src/app/community-programs/page.tsx` - Main listing page
2. `src/app/community-programs/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual program pages

**This means:** To add programs now, you edit the code directly (not ideal but works).

### **What I've Set Up For You:**

‚úÖ **Database schema** - Professional table structure
‚úÖ **Migration SQL** - Creates the table in Supabase
‚úÖ **Migration script** - Moves existing 6 programs to database
‚úÖ **Add program script** - Interactive CLI tool to add programs easily
‚úÖ **Complete documentation** - Everything you need to know

---

## üöÄ Quick Start: Add a Program NOW

### **Option 1: Quick Add (Edit Files)**

**For adding 1-2 programs quickly:**

1. Open `src/app/community-programs/page.tsx`
2. Find line 45: `const samplePrograms: CommunityProgram[] = [`
3. Copy an existing program object
4. Update all fields with your program's info
5. Increment the `id` field (e.g., from '6' to '7')
6. Repeat in `src/app/community-programs/[id]/page.tsx`

**Pro:** Works immediately
**Con:** Must edit code; not scalable for many programs

---

### **Option 2: Database Setup (Better Long-term)**

**For adding many programs over time:**

#### **Step 1: Create Database Table**

```bash
# Go to Supabase Dashboard
# SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
# Copy/paste: supabase/migrations/create-community-programs-table.sql
# Run it
```

#### **Step 2: Migrate Existing Programs**

```bash
DOTENV_CONFIG_PATH=.env.local NODE_OPTIONS='--require dotenv/config' npx tsx src/scripts/migrate-programs-to-database.ts
```

This moves the 6 existing programs into the database.

#### **Step 3: Add New Programs**

```bash
DOTENV_CONFIG_PATH=.env.local NODE_OPTIONS='--require dotenv/config' npx tsx src/scripts/add-community-program.ts
```

This starts an interactive questionnaire. Just answer the questions!

- Relationship-focused
- Practical support
- Embedded locally
- **Examples:** BackTrack, Creative Futures

### **Grassroots**
- Started by community (often lived experience)
- Bottom-up organization
- Youth-led or peer-led
- Social justice focus
- **Examples:** Logan Youth Collective

### **Culturally-responsive**
- Adapts to cultural needs

  organization: 'Brodie Germaine Fitness',
  location: 'Mount Isa',
  state: 'QLD',
  approach: 'Indigenous-led',
  description: 'Camping on Country program combining cultural immersion, physical fitness, and mentorship for Indigenous youth in Northwest Queensland. Seven-day expeditions with Elders teaching traditional practices.',
  impact_summary: 'Reconnecting Indigenous youth to culture and country - 85% show improved wellbeing and reduced justice involvement',
  success_rate: 85,
  participants_served: 150,
  years_operating: 3,
  contact_phone: '0400 123 456',
  contact_email: 'brodie@germainefitness.com.au',
  website: 'https://brodiegermainefitness.com.au',
  is_featured: true,
  indigenous_knowledge: true,
  community_connection_score: 98,
  tags: [
    'Cultural Connection',
    'On Country',

## üö¶ Implementation Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Setup (One-time)**
1. Run database migration
2. Migrate existing 6 programs
3. Test that programs load from database

### **Phase 2: Add Programs**
1. Use interactive script to add programs
2. OR edit files directly for quick adds
3. Verify they show on website

### **Phase 3: Update Pages (Optional)**
1. Update pages to read from database
2. Remove hardcoded data
3. Add admin interface for editing

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with programs you know well** - Your direct experience is gold
2. **Get permission first** - Check with organizations before listing
3. **Verify contact info** - Make sure it's current
4. **Be honest with metrics** - Estimates okay, just note them
5. **Focus on impact** - What ACTUALLY changes?
6. **Cultural sensitivity** - Get approval for Indigenous programs
7. **Update regularly** - Programs change, keep info fresh

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### **Scenario 1: You visited a program last week**

1. While memory is fresh, jot down notes
2. Run: `npx tsx src/scripts/add-community-program.ts`
3. Answer questions based on your visit
4. Done! Program is live

### **Scenario 2: Adding 10 programs from your travels**

1. Create spreadsheet with program info
2. Run migration to set up database
3. For each program, run add script
4. Takes ~5 minutes per program

### **Scenario 3: Quick add for demo**

1. Edit `page.tsx` files
2. Copy existing program
3. Change all fields
4. Increment ID
5. Refresh page - done!

---

## üìû Questions?

### "Can I add programs without full info?"
**Yes!** Add what you know, leave optional fields blank. Update later.

### "What if I'm not sure about metrics?"
**Make an estimate** and note it in description like "approximately X%"

### "How do I feature a program?"
Set `is_featured: true` - it shows in the featured section

### "Can I add programs from other states?"
**Absolutely!** We want nationwide coverage

### "What if contact info changes?"
Easy to update in database or code files
