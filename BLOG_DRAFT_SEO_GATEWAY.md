### Post Content

In Mount Isa, Queensland, there's a question that keeps coming up: Who's actually doing the work?

Government services with multi-million dollar budgets talk about "wrap-around support" and "evidence-based interventions." They collect data. They write reports. They attend meetings.

And when a 14-year-old is in crisis at 2am? They don't answer the phone.

**Aunty Corrine does.**

For 20 years, unpaid.

## The Math That Doesn't Add Up

Let's look at the numbers:

**Government side:**
- Millions in annual funding
- Offices, staff, programs
- "Tick-and-flick" service delivery
- Data collection and reporting
- Young people still cycling through detention

**Community side:**
- $0 in funding
- 24/7 availability
- 25 young people supported over 20 years
- Most now independent, stable, connected to family
- None in long-term detention

One of these approaches is working. One is compensated.

They're not the same one.

## What Unpaid Expertise Actually Looks Like

Aunty Corrine calls them "MBBs"—Misunderstood Black Boys. Because she sees what systems don't.

A boy sat in Cleveland Youth Detention Centre for four days without speaking. Trained staff tried everything—psychologists, counselors, youth workers. Nothing worked.

Aunty Corrine walked in: "What's your name, darling?"

The boy looked up: "I'm not allowed to say my name to white people."

Within 30 minutes, he was talking. Within two days, he was out.

**This is the expertise that no qualification can teach.**

It comes from lived experience. From cultural knowledge. From showing up when everyone else has given up. From understanding that a "Misunderstood Black Boy" isn't a problem to be managed—he's a young person who needs connection, support, and someone who actually sees him.

## The Pattern Across Australia

Mount Isa isn't unique. Across Australia, this pattern repeats:

- **Bourke, NSW:** Community-led Maranguka Justice Reinvestment reduced youth offending by 31%
- **NSW Youth Koori Court:** Elder-led model shows better outcomes than conventional courts
- **Redfern, Sydney:** Community-controlled services deliver where government programs fail

The evidence is clear: **community-led approaches work.**

But we keep funding the same systems that don't.

## The Real Cost of "Free" Community Labor

When we say Aunty Corrine's work is "unpaid," what does that actually mean?

**It means:**
- Answering calls at 2am instead of sleeping
- Driving hours to Cleveland Detention Centre, using her own petrol
- Providing meals, housing, support from her own resources
- Carrying the emotional weight of 25 young people's struggles
- Two decades of expertise with zero compensation

**Meanwhile, services are funded to:**
- Operate 9-5 (if that)
- Collect data about the community
- Write reports Aunties never see
- Deliver programs that young people don't trust
- Tick boxes that don't keep anyone safe

This isn't just unfair. It's unsustainable.

## What "Community-Led" Actually Requires

Aunty Corrine is clear about what's needed:

**"I need voices behind me. Not just funding. Voices."**

Not another service extracting community knowledge.
Not more "consultation" where Elders are heard but not listened to.
Not funding that requires fitting into government boxes.

What's needed is:

1. **Decision-making power** - Aunties control the programs, services don't
2. **Infrastructure** - A building communities own, not another service lease
3. **Compensation for expertise** - Fair payment for 20 years of knowledge
4. **Sustainability** - Systems that don't depend on unpaid labor forever

This is what community-led actually looks like.

## The Questions We Should Be Asking

The Mount Isa story raises questions for anyone working in justice, social services, or policy:

**For service providers:**
Are you supporting community expertise or replacing it?

**For funders:**
Are you paying for infrastructure communities control or services that extract data?

**For policymakers:**
Are you creating structures for community decision-making or just more consultation?

**For researchers:**
Are you documenting community knowledge or appropriating it?

**For all of us:**
What would justice look like if we compensated expertise instead of extracting it?

## The Evidence We Keep Ignoring

Of the 25 young people Aunty Corrine has supported:
- Most are now independent, in stable housing, connected to family
- None are in long-term detention
- All received support no funded service provided
- Success came from relationships, not programs

**This is evidence.**

Not anecdotal. Not "promising." Evidence.

The same kind of evidence that, if it came from a university study with a million-dollar budget, would be published in journals and cited in policy documents.

But because it comes from an Aunty in Mount Isa, it's called "community knowledge"—acknowledged, appreciated, underpaid.

## What Comes Next

Aunty Corrine's story isn't just about Mount Isa. It's about a pattern we see everywhere:

Communities know what works. Systems don't listen. Services get funded anyway. Communities keep doing the work unpaid.

Until we break this pattern—until we move from extracting community expertise to actually compensating it, from consultation to decision-making power, from services to infrastructure—we'll keep getting the same results.

Millions spent. "Tick-and-flick funding" rolling in. And Aunties answering calls at 2am, unpaid, doing the actual work of keeping communities safe.

**There's a better way.**

It starts with voices. With power. With infrastructure communities control.

It starts with recognizing that 20 years of supporting 25 young people through the justice system isn't "community volunteering."

It's expertise. And it should be compensated like expertise.
