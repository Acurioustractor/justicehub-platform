## SLIDE 2: The Problem

# **Communities Trapped in Dependency Cycles**

**The Current Reality:**
- Indigenous communities spend **30-40%** of time writing grants[^1]
- Proven programs remain **invisible** and **uncompensated**
- Knowledge **extracted** without compensation or control
- Programs **shut down** when funding ends
- **No pathway** from dependency to self-determination

**The Cost:**
- Sector wastes **$5M+ annually** reinventing existing solutions
- Young people cycle through systems that don't work
- Communities exhausted by **consultation without action**

---

## SLIDE 3: Our Solution

# **Community Ownership + Economic Self-Determination**

**What We're Building:**
1. **Community-Owned Platform** - Not "community-led," actually owned by communities
2. **Economic Self-Determination** - Revenue streams, not perpetual grants
3. **Break Dependency Cycles** - Financial independence by Year 5
4. **Knowledge Sovereignty** - Communities control their intellectual property
5. **Global Leadership** - Australia as world leader in Indigenous-led justice

**This Is Different:**
- ✅ Seed capital for **permanent infrastructure**
- ✅ Costs **reducing over time** through community capacity
- ✅ **Time-limited partnership** (3-5 years), not ongoing dependency
- ✅ Platform **legally transfers** to communities by Year 5

---

## SLIDE 4: How It Works - The Capacity Building Model

# **Year 1 → Year 3: From External to Community-Led**

**Year 1: Build + Train**

- **20-26% cost reduction** through community capacity
- Revenue generation: **$50-500K**
- Community Governance Board operational

## SLIDE 10: Strategic Alignment with Mindaroo

# **Youth Justice **AND** Early Childhood Prevention**

**The 0-5 Connection:**
- **Intergenerational trauma prevention** - Supporting youth today prevents trauma for tomorrow's children
- **Longitudinal evidence** - Track which 0-5 programmes prevent later justice involvement
- **Family-centred approaches** - Communities support whole families across life course
- **Prevention ROI** - Platform enables cost-benefit analysis for early intervention

**But Also:**
- Youth justice impact is **primary driver**
- Project stands on its own merit
- 0-5 connection is **strategic bonus**, not foundation

---

## SLIDE 11: What Makes This Different

# **Transformational, Not Transactional Philanthropy**

**Traditional Model:**
- Ongoing programme funding
- Dependency on external organisations
- Costs stay same or increase
- No exit strategy

**JusticeHub Model:**
- ✅ **Seed capital** for permanent infrastructure
- ✅ **Costs reducing** through community capacity (20-26% by Year 3)
- ✅ **Revenue generation** - communities earning income
- ✅ **Community ownership** - legal transfer by Year 5
- ✅ **Clear exit** - A Curious Tractor transitions to service provider, not owner

**Your investment creates something that:**
- Exists **forever**
- Is **owned by communities**
- Generates **sustainable revenue**
- Reduces **sector's philanthropic dependency**

## SLIDE 14: Risk Mitigation

# **How We Address Key Risks**

**Risk: Community Consultation Fatigue**
→ **Mitigation:** Pay properly, show early wins, decision-making power to communities

**Risk: Technology Adoption**
→ **Mitigation:** Mobile-first design, offline capability, in-person support

**Risk: Funding Sustainability**
→ **Mitigation:** Diversified revenue from Year 1, conservative projections, community capacity building

**Risk: Cultural Appropriation**
→ **Mitigation:** First Nations Advisory Council controls all cultural protocols, communities own content

**Risk: Misalignment with Mindaroo**
→ **Mitigation:** Clear 0-5 connection articulated, regular reporting, flexibility to adapt
