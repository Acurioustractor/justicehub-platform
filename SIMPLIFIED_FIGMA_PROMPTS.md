## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Copy the prompt** for the visualization you want
2. **Paste into Figma Make**
3. **Wait for generation** (2-5 minutes)
4. **Refine manually** if needed:
   - Adjust spacing
   - Perfect colors
   - Fine-tune typography
5. **Export** in multiple formats

**Order of priority:**
1. Network Map (easiest, clearest)
2. System Transformation (powerful before/after)
3. Local to Scale (clear 3-step flow)
4. Connection Web (stakeholder value)
5. Budget Scenarios (financial clarity)
