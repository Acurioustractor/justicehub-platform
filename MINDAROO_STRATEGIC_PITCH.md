# JusticeHub Strategic Pitch for Mindaroo Foundation
## Linking Early Childhood to Youth Justice Through Community-Led Intelligence

**Prepared for:** Mindaroo Foundation
**Lead Organisation:** A Curious Tractor
**Date:** October 2025
**Contact:** [Your details]

---

## Executive Summary

JusticeHub represents a transformative approach to youth justice through community ownership, economic self-determination, and Indigenous-led innovation. By creating a digital intelligence platform owned and governed by communities—not organisations or governments—we fundamentally shift power dynamics in how justice knowledge is created, shared, and valued.

**What We're Building:**
- **Community-Owned Platform:** Digital infrastructure governed by Indigenous communities, not external organisations
- **Economic Self-Determination Model:** Innovative revenue streams that break philanthropic dependency cycles
- **Transition to Community Control:** Platform transfers from A Curious Tractor to community-governed ACCO by Year 5
- **Sustainable Knowledge Economy:** Communities compensated for sharing intelligence, creating long-term financial independence
- **Global Indigenous Network:** International connections for knowledge exchange and collective influence

**Strategic Alignment with Mindaroo:**
While youth justice is our core focus, this work directly supports Mindaroo's early childhood prevention priorities:
- Intergenerational trauma prevention: Supporting youth today prevents trauma for tomorrow's young children
- Evidence infrastructure: Longitudinal tracking demonstrates which 0-5 programs prevent later justice involvement
- Family-centered approaches: Communities know that supporting young people requires supporting whole families
- This connection is significant, but youth justice impact is the primary driver

**Three-Year Budget Request:**
- **Level 1 (Minimal Viable):** $4.0M - $5.6M total over 3 years
- **Level 2 (Foundational - RECOMMENDED):** $7.5M - $10.5M total over 3 years
- **Level 3 (Comprehensive):** $13M - $17M total over 3 years
- **Recommended ask:** $7.5M - $10.5M (Level 2)

**Projected Impact (3 Years):**
- **Community ownership:** Platform legally owned and governed by Indigenous communities by Year 5
- **Breaking dependency cycles:** Target 30-75% financially self-sustaining by Year 5, reducing philanthropic reliance
- **Economic benefits to communities:** Community investment fund redistributes profits to participating communities
- **Knowledge reach:** Projected 20-50 communities directly engaged, 2,000-10,000 practitioners accessing platform
- **Systems change:** From fragmented local programs to connected global best-practice network
- **Youth impact:** Estimated 50,000-100,000+ young people and families benefit from improved practice

## Part 1: The Strategic Case

### Why JusticeHub Matters

**The Core Problem: Power, Knowledge, and Perpetual Dependency**

Indigenous communities across Australia and globally have developed effective, culturally-grounded approaches to youth justice. But this knowledge remains invisible, uncompensated, and impossible to access by others who need it. More critically, communities remain trapped in cycles of philanthropic dependency—with practitioners spending an estimated 30-40% of their time writing grants and justifying their existence[^1], only to have programs shut down when funding ends. Meanwhile, their intellectual property and cultural intelligence is extracted, documented in academic papers and government reports, with no compensation or control.

**Our Solution: Community Ownership & Economic Self-Determination**

JusticeHub fundamentally shifts who owns and benefits from justice knowledge. This isn't about creating another platform—it's about building community power through:

1. **True Community Ownership (Not Just "Community-Led")**
   - Platform legally owned by community-governed Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation (ACCO) by Year 5
   - A Curious Tractor's role transitions from owner to service provider
   - Communities control all decisions: what's shared, how it's used, who benefits
   - No external organisation can pull funding and shut it down
   - Permanent infrastructure that outlives individual projects or funders

2. **Breaking Philanthropic Dependency Cycles**
   - Innovative revenue streams reduce reliance on grants by 30-75% within 5 years
   - Communities compensated for sharing their knowledge and programs
   - Revenue from memberships, training, consulting flows to Community Investment Fund
   - Fund redistributes to participating communities—not back to organisations or funders
   - Long-term financial sustainability means communities can say "no" to inappropriate funding
   - Economic self-determination, not perpetual grant-seeking

3. **Knowledge Sovereignty & Fair Compensation**
   - Communities decide what knowledge is shared and how
   - Cultural protocols embedded in platform design by First Nations Advisory Council
   - Clear intellectual property rights—communities own their content
   - Compensation for cultural intelligence and program innovations (not extraction)
   - Ability to remove content anytime
   - No academic or government exploitation of community knowledge

4. **Systems Change Through Visibility & Evidence**
   - Proven programs become accessible to funders, policymakers, practitioners
   - Reduced duplication across sector saves an estimated $5M+ annually
   - Evidence base for what works drives policy change
   - Communities positioned as experts and thought leaders, not service recipients
   - Global influence: Australia leads in Indigenous-led justice innovation

**What This Means for Philanthropy:**

This is not a traditional grant relationship. Mindaroo's investment would be:
- **Seed capital for community ownership**, not ongoing program funding
- **Building permanent infrastructure**, not dependent services
- **Creating financial independence**, not creating new dependencies
- **Time-limited partnership** with clear exit strategy (5 years)
- **Multiplier investment**: Revenue model means Mindaroo's dollars multiply—communities continue to benefit long after philanthropic investment ends

Your 3-year investment creates something that exists forever, owned by communities, generating sustainable revenue, and reducing the sector's philanthropic dependency. This is transformational philanthropy, not transactional funding.

**Strategic Fit with Mindaroo's Prevention Focus:**

While youth justice is our primary focus, this work creates critical prevention infrastructure:
- **Intergenerational trauma prevention:** Supporting young people today prevents trauma for their future children
- **Evidence for early childhood programs:** Longitudinal tracking shows which 0-5 interventions prevent later justice involvement
- **Family-centered approaches:** Communities address root causes across the life course, including 0-5 supports
- **Prevention ROI:** Platform enables cost-benefit analysis to demonstrate early intervention impact

This connection strengthens the case and aligns with Mindaroo's priorities, but youth justice communities need this infrastructure regardless of early childhood linkages. The project stands on its own merit—the 0-5 connection is a strategic bonus, not the foundation.

### The Current Crisis

**Information Fragmentation:**
- Best-practice programs remain hidden in individual communities
- Practitioners reinvent solutions that already exist elsewhere
- Research sits in academic journals, not practitioner hands
- Indigenous knowledge is extracted but never returned or compensated

**Funding Inefficiency:**
- Organisations spend an estimated 30-40% of time writing grants for funding they don't receive
- Successful models can't scale due to lack of visibility
- Funders can't find effective programs to support
- Government programs duplicated across jurisdictions without learning

**Community Exhaustion:**
- Repeated consultations with no action
- Programs imposed without community input
- No pathway from service recipient to service designer
- Cultural intelligence extracted without compensation

### The Opportunity

**Existing Assets:**
- 50+ proven community-led programs ready to share (documented through Justice Reinvestment work)
- Growing network of justice reinvestment communities (Bourke, Moree, Mount Isa, etc.)
- Potential funding partners expressing strong interest (Dusseldorp, Snow Foundation, Paul Ramsay Foundation, Fairfax Foundation)
- Technical infrastructure: program directory supported by Justice Reinvestment initiatives, with platform architecture ready for expansion
- International interest (Indigenous communities globally seeking connection)

**Market Gap:**
- No centralized intelligence hub for youth justice best practices
- No platform for Indigenous-to-Indigenous knowledge sharing
- No sustainable model for community-owned justice innovation
- No bridge between early childhood and youth justice evidence

**Timing:**
- Queensland government has invested $330 million in justice community programs, including Circuit Breaker ($80M)
- National Justice Reinvestment expansion across multiple states
- Growing recognition of Indigenous-led solutions as best practice
- Post-pandemic acceptance of digital knowledge-sharing infrastructure
- Mindaroo's commitment to systems change and early childhood prevention

## Part 9: The Ask

### What We're Requesting from Mindaroo

**Primary Request: 3-Year Commitment to Level 2 - Foundational Excellence ($7.5M - $10.5M)**

This is a time-limited partnership to build permanent community-owned infrastructure:

**Year 1:** $2.0M - $2.8M
- Foundation: 6 communities, platform development, team building
- Begin training 4-5 young Indigenous developers/producers
- Establish First Nations Advisory Council
- International learning exchange (NZ)
- Early evidence generation

**Year 2:** $2.5M - $3.5M (subject to Year 1 progress review)

## Conclusion: An Invitation to Partnership

This is not just a funding request. It's an invitation to partner in building something that could fundamentally change how we approach youth justice, early childhood prevention, and Indigenous self-determination.

**This is about:**
- Trusting communities to know what they need
- Investing in prevention, not just crisis response
- Building sustainable infrastructure, not dependent programs
- Connecting 0-5 interventions to lifelong outcomes
- Valuing Indigenous intelligence as equal to Western research
- Creating global models that others can learn from
- Demonstrating that alternative funding approaches work

**The opportunity is now:**
- Communities are ready and asking for this
- Sector is eager for better coordination and knowledge sharing
- Technology makes knowledge sharing accessible
- International interest in Indigenous-led approaches is high
- Mindaroo has the vision and resources to make this happen

**The risk of not doing this:**
- Continued fragmentation and reinvention
- Indigenous knowledge continues to be extracted, not valued
- Young people continue to suffer from systems that don't work
- 0-5 investments can't prove long-term prevention impact
- Australia misses opportunity to lead globally

We believe this is the right work, at the right time, with the right partners. We hope Mindaroo agrees.
