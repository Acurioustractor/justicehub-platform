## Linking Early Childhood to Youth Justice Through Community-Led Intelligence

**Prepared for:** Mindaroo Foundation
**Lead Organization:** A Curious Tractor
**Date:** October 2025
**Contact:** [Your details]

---

## Executive Summary

JusticeHub represents a transformative approach to breaking the pipeline from early childhood adversity to youth justice involvement. By creating a community-owned digital intelligence platform and support ecosystem, we address the critical gap between early childhood intervention and youth justice outcomes.

**The Connection to 0-5 Years:**
- 85% of youth in justice systems experienced adverse childhood experiences before age 5
- Early intervention programs need long-term tracking to demonstrate impact beyond age 5
- Community intelligence gathering starts with families and extends through the life course
- Indigenous-led approaches recognize that supporting young people today prevents intergenerational trauma for tomorrow's 0-5 year olds

**Three-Year Budget Request:**
- **Year 1 (Foundation):** $3.2M - $5.8M
- **Year 2 (Growth):** $4.5M - $8.2M
- **Year 3 (Scale):** $5.8M - $10.5M
- **Total 3-Year Investment:** $13.5M - $24.5M

**Impact Potential:**
- Direct reach: 50+ communities, 200+ organizations, 10,000+ practitioners
- Indirect reach: 100,000+ young people and families
- Knowledge multiplication: From fragmented local programs to global best-practice network
- Sustainability pathway: 60% self-sustaining by Year 5 through social enterprise model

## Part 1: The Strategic Case

### Why This Matters for 0-5 Years Strategy

The pathway to youth justice involvement is established in early childhood, but current approaches fail to:

1. **Track Long-Term Outcomes**
   - Early childhood interventions stop tracking at age 5
   - No visibility into which programs prevent later justice involvement
   - JusticeHub creates the connective tissue to demonstrate 0-5 program efficacy

2. **Support Families Holistically**
   - Parents of 0-5 year olds in justice-impacted communities face unique challenges
   - Intergenerational trauma means today's youth justice solutions prevent tomorrow's early childhood trauma
   - Community-led approaches recognize whole-of-family support needs

3. **Build Community Capacity**
   - Indigenous communities know what works for their 0-5 year olds
   - Current systems don't capture or share this intelligence
   - JusticeHub creates infrastructure for community-to-community learning

4. **Demonstrate Prevention ROI**
   - Every $1 invested in early childhood saves $7-13 in later costs
   - But we can't prove it without tracking systems
   - JusticeHub provides the evidence infrastructure to show prevention impact

### The Current Crisis

**Information Fragmentation:**
- Best-practice programs remain hidden in individual communities
- Practitioners reinvent solutions that already exist elsewhere
- Research sits in academic journals, not practitioner hands
- Indigenous knowledge is extracted but never returned or compensated

**Funding Inefficiency:**
- Organizations spend 30-40% of time writing grants for funding they don't receive
- Successful models can't scale due to lack of visibility
- Funders can't find effective programs to support
- Government programs duplicated across jurisdictions without learning

**Community Exhaustion:**
- Repeated consultations with no action
- Programs imposed without community input
- No pathway from service recipient to service designer
- Cultural intelligence extracted without compensation

### The Opportunity

**Existing Assets:**
- 50+ proven community-led programs ready to share
- Growing network of justice reinvestment communities (Bourke, Moree, Mount Isa, etc.)
- Strong funder partnerships (Dusseldorp, Snow Foundation, Paul Ramsay Foundation)
- Technical infrastructure (existing JusticeHub platform v1)
- International interest (Indigenous communities globally seeking connection)

**Market Gap:**
- No centralized intelligence hub for youth justice best practices
- No platform for Indigenous-to-Indigenous knowledge sharing
- No sustainable model for community-owned justice innovation
- No bridge between early childhood and youth justice evidence

**Timing:**
- Queensland Circuit Breaker program launching ($80M investment)
- National Justice Reinvestment expansion
- Growing recognition of Indigenous-led solutions
- Post-pandemic digital infrastructure acceptance
- Mindaroo's commitment to systems change and early childhood

## Part 8: Investment Decision Framework

### Three Scenarios for Mindaroo

**Scenario 1: Test the Model - Level 1 ($3.2M - $4.5M)**

**Choose this if:**
- You want to test the concept with lower risk
- 0-5 connection needs more development and proof
- Starting small aligns with learnings about large capital injection risks
- Other portfolio projects need prioritization

**You get:**
- Proven model with 3 pilot communities
- Digital infrastructure and foundational content
- Evidence of community engagement and impact
- Foundation for future scaling
- Pathway to sustainability demonstrated

**Limitation:**
- Slower path to systems change
- Less comprehensive impact
- Minimal international dimension
- More dependent on future funding for scale

**This is the safe choice** - proves concept, builds trust, creates foundation.

---

**Scenario 2: Build it Right - Level 2 ($5.8M - $8.5M)**

**Choose this if:**
- You believe in the model and want meaningful impact
- You're ready to invest in systems change over 3 years
- You want to demonstrate thought leadership in youth justice
- Connection to 0-5 strategy is clear enough to proceed

**You get:**
- Comprehensive infrastructure with strong community ownership
- 6 pilot communities deeply engaged
- National forums and thought leadership
- Clear evidence of impact and practice change
- Strong pathway to sustainability (30-60% self-sustaining by Year 5)
- Foundation for international work

**Limitation:**
- Not the "wow factor" of comprehensive level
- International work limited
- Media/arts component smaller

**This is the sweet spot** - meaningful impact, clear path to sustainability, manageable risk.

---

**Scenario 3: Transform the System - Level 3 ($8.5M - $10.5M)**

**Choose this if:**
- You want to make a bold statement about valuing Indigenous intelligence
- You're ready for significant systems change and global leadership
- You see youth justice as integral to 0-5 strategy
- You want to demonstrate alternative funding models

**You get:**
- Comprehensive transformation across 10 communities
- International Indigenous intelligence network
- Media and arts cultural change campaign
- Strong revenue generation and sustainability (75-90% by Year 5)
- Community ownership and self-determination model
- Global influence and replication
- Clear ROI and prevention evidence

**Limitation:**
- Higher upfront investment
- More complex to manage
- Higher risk if model doesn't work

**This is the bold choice** - signals that Indigenous knowledge matters, creates global model, drives real systems change.

---

### Recommended Approach: Phased Decision Making

**Phase 1: Year 1 - Commit to Level 2 Foundation ($1.6M - $2.2M)**
- Test the model with 6 communities
- Develop platform and core infrastructure
- Establish governance and community ownership pathway
- Generate early evidence of impact

**Phase 2: Year 2 Decision Point - Scale Based on Evidence**
- If impact is clear: Move to Level 3 comprehensive ($3.2M)
- If impact is promising but needs refinement: Continue Level 2 growth ($2.0M - $3.0M)
- If challenges emerge: Pull back to Level 1 maintenance ($1.1M) and re-plan

**Phase 3: Year 3 - Sustainability Transition**
- Community ownership structure operational
- Revenue generation established
- Evidence of systems change documented
- Planning for Years 4-5 reduced philanthropic dependence

**This approach:**
- Manages risk while allowing for bold action
- Creates decision points based on evidence
- Allows Mindaroo to see impact before full commitment
- Respects learnings about large capital injections
- Maintains flexibility to adapt

## Conclusion: An Invitation to Partnership

This is not just a funding request. It's an invitation to partner in building something that could fundamentally change how we approach youth justice, early childhood prevention, and Indigenous self-determination.

**This is about:**
- Trusting communities to know what they need
- Investing in prevention, not just crisis response
- Building sustainable infrastructure, not dependent programs
- Connecting 0-5 interventions to lifelong outcomes
- Valuing Indigenous intelligence as equal to Western research
- Creating global models that others can learn from
- Demonstrating that alternative funding approaches work

**The opportunity is now:**
- Communities are ready and asking for this
- Sector is eager for better coordination and knowledge sharing
- Technology makes knowledge sharing accessible
- International interest in Indigenous-led approaches is high
- Mindaroo has the vision and resources to make this happen

**The risk of not doing this:**
- Continued fragmentation and reinvention
- Indigenous knowledge continues to be extracted, not valued
- Young people continue to suffer from systems that don't work
- 0-5 investments can't prove long-term prevention impact
- Australia misses opportunity to lead globally

We believe this is the right work, at the right time, with the right partners. We hope Mindaroo agrees.
