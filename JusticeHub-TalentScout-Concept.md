# JusticeHub: Youth-Talent Scout Platform
### *Triple-J Unearthed for Justice*

## 🎵 The Big Idea

**JusticeHub transforms every grassroots organization into a Youth-Talent Scout** — like record labels discovering the next chart-topper, but for community change-makers.

Young people upload the "demo tapes" of their lives. Local orgs become the A&R scouts who spot, coach, and launch the next headliners of social impact.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Scouting Raw Talent**
Front-line workers and Elders invite youth to record their first takes:
- Set personal goals (creative, cultural, career)
- Share their story through voice or video
- Design their own rewards and milestones

### 2. **Production & Coaching**
Paid youth apprentices help polish and publish:
- Clip and tag stories for maximum impact
- Track progress on the dashboard
- Build evidence portfolios automatically

### 3. **Release & Promotion**
When youth hit milestones:
- Dashboard creates shareable "singles" (videos/quote cards)
- Auto-generates impact reports for funders
- Pushes success stories to social channels

### 4. **Signing the Deal**
Employers browse JusticeHub like labels browse SoundCloud:
- Direct offers for internships and gigs
- Micro-grants for youth projects
- Educational pathways and opportunities

### 5. **Royalties Return Home**
Built-in revenue tracking ensures:
- Youth get paid when their stories unlock funding
- Organizations receive a share for hosting
- Complete transparency in the value chain
