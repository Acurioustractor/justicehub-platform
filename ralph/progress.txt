## 2026-01-06T12:00:00Z - justicehub-map-fix

**Feature Completed:** Fix JusticeHub Australia Nodes Map

**Summary:**
Fixed the AustraliaNodesMap component to prevent markers from "jumping" on hover. The issue was caused by changing the marker size during hover states. The fix implements:
- Fixed-size container wrapping each marker to prevent layout shifts
- Replaced size-changing hover effect with a pulsing ring indicator
- Added tooltip arrow pointing to the marker
- Made tooltips non-interactive to prevent hover flicker

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Map displays with Australia background
- ✅ Nodes appear at correct state/territory positions (hardcoded %)
- ✅ Hover shows tooltip without moving the marker
- ✅ Click selects the node
- ✅ Build passes without errors

**Files Modified:**
- src/components/AustraliaNodesMap.tsx

## 2026-01-06T14:30:00Z - justicehub-event-registration

**Feature Completed:** Review Journey 2: Event Registration Flow

**Summary:**
Reviewed and completed the event registration flow. The existing events listing page and event detail page were already functional. The missing piece was the generic event registration route `/events/[id]/register` which was referenced in the event detail page but did not exist. Created a new registration page with:
- 3-step registration wizard (Your Details, Preferences, Confirmation)
- Dynamic event fetching and validation (redirects if event is past)
- Integration with existing /api/ghl/register endpoint
- GoHighLevel CRM sync and database submission
- JusticeHub brand-consistent styling
- Confirmation display with event details after successful registration

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Events page displays upcoming events
- ✅ Event detail page shows full information
- ✅ Registration form works and submits to database
- ✅ Confirmation is shown after registration
- ✅ Build passes without errors

**Files Modified:**
- src/app/events/[id]/register/page.tsx (created)
