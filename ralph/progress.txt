## 2026-01-06T12:00:00Z - justicehub-map-fix

**Feature Completed:** Fix JusticeHub Australia Nodes Map

**Summary:**
Fixed the AustraliaNodesMap component to prevent markers from "jumping" on hover. The issue was caused by changing the marker size during hover states. The fix implements:
- Fixed-size container wrapping each marker to prevent layout shifts
- Replaced size-changing hover effect with a pulsing ring indicator
- Added tooltip arrow pointing to the marker
- Made tooltips non-interactive to prevent hover flicker

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Map displays with Australia background
- ✅ Nodes appear at correct state/territory positions (hardcoded %)
- ✅ Hover shows tooltip without moving the marker
- ✅ Click selects the node
- ✅ Build passes without errors

**Files Modified:**
- src/components/AustraliaNodesMap.tsx

## 2026-01-06T14:30:00Z - justicehub-event-registration

**Feature Completed:** Review Journey 2: Event Registration Flow

**Summary:**
Reviewed and completed the event registration flow. The existing events listing page and event detail page were already functional. The missing piece was the generic event registration route `/events/[id]/register` which was referenced in the event detail page but did not exist. Created a new registration page with:
- 3-step registration wizard (Your Details, Preferences, Confirmation)
- Dynamic event fetching and validation (redirects if event is past)
- Integration with existing /api/ghl/register endpoint
- GoHighLevel CRM sync and database submission
- JusticeHub brand-consistent styling
- Confirmation display with event details after successful registration

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Events page displays upcoming events
- ✅ Event detail page shows full information
- ✅ Registration form works and submits to database
- ✅ Confirmation is shown after registration
- ✅ Build passes without errors

**Files Modified:**
- src/app/events/[id]/register/page.tsx (created)

## 2026-01-07T10:00:00Z - justicehub-steward-signup

**Feature Completed:** Review Journey 3: Steward Signup Flow

**Summary:**
Reviewed and verified the steward/volunteer signup flow. The existing implementation was comprehensive with:
- Multi-step signup wizard at /signup?role=steward (account → profile → steward-info)
- Dedicated landing page at /stewards with tier options (Community, Professional, Organization)
- Integration with GoHighLevel CRM for contact management and tagging
- Database persistence to public_profiles, users, and newsletter_subscriptions tables

Fixed two issues:
1. Removed 'source' column reference from /api/ghl/signup (column doesn't exist in newsletter_subscriptions table)
2. Added database migration to create 'metadata' JSONB column in public_profiles for storing steward-specific data (motivation, experience, commitments)

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Steward signup page is accessible at /signup?role=steward
- ✅ Form validates required fields (email, password 8+ chars, password match, full name, steward motivation)
- ✅ Submission creates records in database (auth user, public_profiles with role_tags=['steward'], users, newsletter_subscriptions)
- ✅ Confirmation shown via redirect to profile page after signup + Supabase sends email confirmation
- ✅ Build passes without errors

**Files Modified:**
- src/app/api/ghl/signup/route.ts (fixed source column issue)
- supabase/migrations/20260107000001_add_metadata_to_profiles.sql (created)

**Intelligence Hub (/intelligence):**
- Main landing page with ALMA stats (interventions, evidence, outcomes, states coverage)
- Four exploration cards linking to Media Intelligence, Intervention Database, Portfolio Analytics, and The Pattern Story
- Recent intelligence updates showing policy tensions and emerging patterns

**Evidence Research (/intelligence/evidence):**
- Client-side filtering with real-time search across title, findings, and author
- Evidence type dropdown filter (8 types: RCT, Quasi-experimental, Program evaluation, etc.)
- Sticky filter bar with clear filters button
- Results display with evidence type badges, author, organization, publication date
- Links to detail pages for each evidence record

**Interventions Database (/intelligence/interventions):**
- Server-side filtering with URL search params
- Filters: search query, state, type, consent level, sort order
- Pagination with previous/next controls
- InterventionCard component with evidence badges and consent indicators

**Detail Pages:**
- Evidence detail (/intelligence/evidence/[id]): Key findings, methodology, study population, geographic context, DOI citations, source URLs, consent level, cultural authority
- Intervention detail (/intelligence/interventions/[id]): Description, evidence base, outcomes, contexts, source documents, portfolio score card with 5 signals, similar programs sidebar
- Media detail (/intelligence/media/[id]): Sentiment analysis, key quotes, topics, geographic focus, stakeholders, policy implications

**Search & Filtering:**
- Unified search API (/api/search) searching across interventions, services, people, organizations
- Related content API (/api/related-content) for showing citations and linked content
- All filters work correctly with real-time updates

**Citations & Sources:**
- Evidence records show source title, author (with profile link), publication year, DOI (clickable), source URL
- Media articles show source name, author, published date, article URL
- Interventions show organization, contact info, website, cultural authority attribution
- Data governance tags displayed: consent level, cultural authority, permitted uses

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Intelligence page displays available research (hub with stats and exploration cards)
- ✅ Search and filtering works (evidence: client-side; interventions: server-side with URL params)
- ✅ Detail pages show full content (evidence, interventions, media all have comprehensive detail views)
- ✅ Citations and sources are properly formatted (DOI links, source URLs, author profiles, cultural authority)
- ✅ Build passes without errors

**Files Modified:**
- None required - existing implementation was complete and functional
