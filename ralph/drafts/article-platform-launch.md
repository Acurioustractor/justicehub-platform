# Introducing JusticeHub: A New Chapter in Youth Justice

*We acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the lands on which we work and live. We pay our respects to Elders past, present, and emerging, and recognise that sovereignty was never ceded.*

## The Call That Changed Everything

It's 2am. A mother sits at her kitchen table, phone in hand, scrolling through endless websites. Her son was released from youth detention three weeks ago. He needs mental health support. He needs to finish Year 11. He needs a job that'll give him a chance. He needs connection to culture.

She's found four different services. Four different intake processes. Four different waiting lists. None of them talk to each other.

This story isn't unique. It's the reality for thousands of Australian families navigating a system that was never designed to help young people thrive—only to process them.

**Today, we're changing that.**

## One Platform. Whole-Person Support.

JusticeHub is a unified platform connecting justice-involved youth with the support services, community programs, and pathways they need—all in one place.

No more maze of disconnected services. No more falling through gaps. No more starting from scratch with every new worker.

Built by A Curious Tractor (ACT), JusticeHub brings together:

- **Program Discovery**: Find mentorship, education, employment, and cultural programs matched to individual needs and goals
- **Connected Pathways**: Track progress, connect with support coordinators, and see the journey ahead
- **Community Voices**: Read stories from others who've walked similar paths—shared with full consent through our Empathy Ledger integration
- **Service Network**: A coordinated network of organisations working together, not in silos

## Why This Matters

The numbers tell a stark story:

- Over 5,000 young Australians are in youth detention on any given day
- First Nations youth are 17 times more likely to be in detention than their non-Indigenous peers
- Up to 80% of young people in detention have a cognitive disability or mental health condition

But behind every statistic is a young person with potential. A family seeking support. A community invested in their success.

The current system treats young people as problems to be managed. JusticeHub treats them as people with futures to be supported.

## Built Different

JusticeHub isn't just another service directory. It's built on principles that matter:

**Community-Centered**
Designed with and for the communities we serve. Lived experience isn't just consulted—it drives every decision.

**Holistic**
We see the whole person, not just an offence. Mental health, education, employment, culture, family—it's all connected.

**Strength-Based**
We focus on potential, not pathology. What can this young person achieve? What support do they need to get there?

**Culturally Safe**
Indigenous data sovereignty and cultural protocols aren't add-ons—they're foundational. First Nations communities control their stories and their data.

## Join the Movement

JusticeHub launches in early 2025, and we're building the founding community now.

**Service Providers**: Register your organisation and be part of the connected network. Your programs deserve visibility. Your clients deserve coordinated support.

**Funders & Stakeholders**: Partner with us to scale impact. This isn't charity—it's infrastructure for systemic change.

## The Future We're Building

Imagine a system where:

- A young person leaving detention has a warm handoff to community support, not a cold release to nothing
- Service providers know what support is already in place, not starting blind
- Families can see a clear pathway, not an endless maze
- Communities can tell their own stories, on their own terms
- Impact is measured by wellbeing, not just whether someone reoffends

That's the future JusticeHub is building. And we're just getting started.
