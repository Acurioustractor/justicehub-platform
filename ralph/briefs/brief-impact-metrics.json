  "problem_statement": {
    "headline": "Traditional youth justice metrics fail young people",
    "key_points": [
      "Recidivism rates (reoffending within X years) remain the dominant measure of 'success'",
      "This narrow focus misses the holistic reality of transformation",
      "Programs are defunded when they don't reduce recidivism fast enough—even if they're improving lives",
      "Young people become statistics, not people on journeys",
      "Indigenous communities have long known that healing can't be reduced to a single number"
    ],
    "system_critique": "When we measure only what's convenient rather than what matters, we optimise for the wrong outcomes. A young person who stays out of detention but remains isolated, unemployed, and disconnected from culture isn't thriving. A program that builds genuine connection and cultural identity but takes time to show 'official' results may be doing the deepest work."

  "solution_overview": {
    "headline": "JusticeHub measures what actually matters",
    "approach": "ALMA (Adaptive Learning & Measurement Architecture) - a holistic impact framework that uses SIGNALS (direction indicators) not SCORES (rankings)",
    "core_philosophy": [
      "Transformation is a journey, not a destination to be ranked",
      "Community authority is weighted highest - those closest to the work define success",
      "Impact emerges at different time horizons - some changes take years to manifest",
      "Multiple beneficiaries matter - young person, family, community, system"
    ]

  "key_concepts": {
    "signals_not_scores": {
      "title": "Signals, Not Scores",
      "explanation": "Instead of ranking programs 1-10 or comparing them competitively, ALMA uses directional signals:",
