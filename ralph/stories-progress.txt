**Task Completed**: article-platform-launch
**Type**: article
**Category**: seeds 🌱
**Output**: ralph/drafts/article-platform-launch.md
**Word Count**: ~1,050 words

**Summary**: Wrote the JusticeHub launch article following the brief structure:
- Hook: 2am mother story navigating fragmented system
- Problem: Statistics on youth detention, highlighting systemic issues
- Vision: One platform, whole-person support
- Features: Breakdown for youth, providers, community
- Principles: Community-centered, holistic, strength-based, culturally safe
- Call to action: Service providers, families, funders
- Acknowledgment: Traditional Owners

**Quality Notes**:
- ✓ Empowering tone throughout
- ✓ Community-centered (leads with family, not organisation)
- ✓ Specific features mentioned
- ✓ Clear calls to action
- ✓ Traditional Owner acknowledgment included
- ⚠ Statistics need verification from AIHW before publishing
- ⚠ URLs are placeholders - need real links

**Learnings**:
- Opening with human story more compelling than statistics
- Breaking features into audience segments improves clarity
- Including "built different" section helps differentiate from existing solutions

**Next Priority**: brief-empathy-ledger-integration (Priority 3)
