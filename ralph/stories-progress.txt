## 2025-01-08T00:00:00Z
**Task Completed**: article-platform-launch
**Type**: article
**Category**: seeds 🌱
**Output**: ralph/drafts/article-platform-launch.md

- ✓ Traditional Owner acknowledgment included
- ⚠ Statistics need verification from AIHW before publishing

**Next Priority**: brief-empathy-ledger-integration (Priority 3)

**Task Completed**: brief-empathy-ledger-integration
**Type**: brief
**Category**: growth 🌿
**Output**: ralph/briefs/brief-empathy-ledger-integration.json
**Cultural Sensitivity**: ⚠️ FLAGGED - Requires community review before article

**Summary**: Created comprehensive brief on Empathy Ledger integration covering:
- Three-tier consent model (Private → Community → Public)
- Cultural safety features (Elder approval, warnings, sensitivity levels)
- Indigenous data sovereignty principles in practice
- How it works for storytellers, organizations, and readers
- Story types that may appear through integration
- Extensive tone guidance for sensitive topic

**Technical Research**:
- Reviewed actual Empathy Ledger integration code (src/lib/supabase/empathy-ledger.ts)
- Documented real consent fields: privacy_level, is_public, requires_elder_approval
- Captured cultural safety features: cultural_warnings, cultural_sensitivity_level
- Noted Indigenous-controlled organization handling

**Review Requirements**:
- ⚠️ First Nations team review REQUIRED
- ⚠️ Community partner approval recommended
- ⚠️ Technical accuracy check against current implementation

**Learnings**:
- For culturally sensitive content, explain WHY review is needed, not just that it is
- Technical documentation helps ensure accuracy when translating to plain language
- Flagging content as requiring community review upfront prevents awkward corrections later

**Next Priority**: article-community-programs (Priority 4)

## 2025-01-08T00:30:00Z
**Task Completed**: article-community-programs
**Type**: article
**Category**: growth 🌿
**Output**: ralph/drafts/article-community-programs.md
**Word Count**: ~1,300 words

**Summary**: Wrote comprehensive article on community programs available through JusticeHub:
- Hook: Marcus's transformation through BackTrack welding program
- Four program approaches: Indigenous-led, Community-based, Grassroots, Culturally-responsive
- What makes programs work: Trust, strengths-based, holistic, accountability, long-term

**Quality Notes**:
- ✓ ~1,300 words (meets 800-1500 target)
- ✓ Features 4 program types as required
- ✓ Includes how community members can access programs
- ✓ Success-focused, solution-oriented
- ✓ Traditional Owner acknowledgment included
- ⚠ URLs are placeholders - need real links

**Learnings**:
- Categorizing program approaches helps readers identify what type might suit them
- Including "what all great programs share" section reinforces core principles
- Dual audience (youth/families AND service providers) requires separate sections

**Next Priority**: brief-impact-metrics (Priority 5)

## 2025-01-08T00:45:00Z
**Task Completed**: brief-impact-metrics
**Type**: brief
**Category**: harvest 🌾
**Output**: ralph/briefs/brief-impact-metrics.json
**Cultural Sensitivity**: ⚠️ Data sovereignty section requires First Nations review

**Summary**: Created comprehensive brief on JusticeHub's impact measurement framework (ALMA):
- Signals not scores: Growth-framing (high/growing/emerging) instead of competitive rankings
- 12 holistic outcome types across 5 categories (justice, pathways, connection, wellbeing, system)
- Multiple evidence levels including Indigenous-led and community authority
- Time horizons from immediate (<6 months) to long-term (3+ years)
- Multiple beneficiaries: young person, family, community, system
- Data sovereignty and consent ledger built into architecture

**Technical Research**:
- Reviewed ALMA types (src/types/alma.ts): InterventionType, EvidenceLevel, OutcomeType, etc.
- Reviewed impact signals (src/lib/alma/impact-signals.ts): scoreToSignal, ImpactLevel
- Documented 12 OutcomeTypes and 5 EvidenceLevels from actual implementation

**Review Requirements**:
- ⚠️ First Nations team review for data sovereignty section
- ⚠️ Technical accuracy check against ALMA implementation
- ⚠️ May want funder/policy stakeholder review

**Learnings**:
- The codebase's ALMA implementation provides rich detail for accurate content
- Framing "signals not scores" early helps readers understand the paradigm shift
- Data sovereignty deserves its own section, not just a mention

**Next Priority**: article-act-origins (Priority 6)

## 2025-01-08T01:00:00Z
**Task Completed**: brief-act-origins (MODIFIED from article-act-origins)
**Type**: brief (instead of article)
**Category**: roots 🌳
**Output**: ralph/briefs/brief-act-origins.json
**Status**: ⚠️ REQUIRES FOUNDER INPUT - Cannot generate autonomously

**Decision**: Created a brief instead of the article because:
- Origin stories MUST be authentic to the founder's lived experience
- AI-generated founder stories lack credibility and authenticity
- This content requires direct conversation with founder
- The brief provides a framework for that conversation

**Summary**: Created comprehensive brief framework for ACT origin story:
- Questions for founder across 6 key story elements
- Suggested article structure (8 sections)
- Tone guidance (authentic, not polished; humble, not heroic)
- Review requirements (founder approval, First Nations review)
- Process recommendation for developing the article

**Story Elements Outlined**:
1. The Lived Experience - what personal experience shaped this work
2. The Spark - when/how ACT began
3. The Evolution - from idea to current form
4. The Values - where radical humility, obsolescence design emerged
5. First Nations Partnership - how this focus developed
6. Why JusticeHub Now - the flagship platform

**Learnings**:
- Some content types cannot be generated autonomously - they require human voice
- Creating a brief framework is valuable even when article can't be written
- Origin stories need authentic founder voice, not AI approximation
- Flagging content for human development is part of quality control

**Next Action Required**: Share brief with founder, schedule conversation
**Next Priority**: social-launch-campaign (Priority 7)

## 2025-01-08T01:15:00Z
**Task Completed**: social-launch-campaign
**Type**: social_campaign
**Category**: seeds 🌱
**Output**: ralph/social/social-launch-campaign.json
**Posts Created**: 8 posts across 3 platforms

**Summary**: Created 5-day social media campaign for JusticeHub launch:

**Platform Distribution**:
- LinkedIn: 3 posts (announcement, feature highlight, service provider CTA)
- Twitter/X: 3 posts (announcement, principles, vision)
- Facebook: 2 posts (announcement storytelling, engagement question)

**Post Types**:
1. Day 1 AM (LinkedIn): Launch announcement - professional, CTA for service providers

5. Day 2 (Twitter): Principles checklist
6. Day 3 (Facebook): Engagement question - community input
7. Day 4 (LinkedIn): Direct CTA for service provider registration
8. Day 5 (Twitter): Vision statement - campaign close

**Campaign Hashtags**: #JusticeHub #YouthJustice #CommunityFirst #SystemsChange

**Quality Notes**:
- ✓ 8 posts total (meets requirement)
- ✓ Mix of announcement, features, engagement
- ✓ Platform-appropriate formatting
- ✓ Consistent hashtags
- ✓ Links to launch article
- ⚠ Statistics need AIHW verification before publishing
- ⚠ Need to confirm launch article URL is live before campaign

**Learnings**:
- Different platforms need different approaches (LinkedIn: professional, Twitter: concise, Facebook: storytelling)
- Spreading campaign over 5 days maintains momentum without overwhelming
- Engagement posts (questions) work well on Facebook for community building
- Service provider CTA deserves its own dedicated post

**Next Priority**: brief-first-nations-partnerships (Priority 8)
