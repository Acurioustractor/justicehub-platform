**Task Completed**: brief-empathy-ledger-integration
**Type**: brief
**Category**: growth 🌿
**Output**: ralph/briefs/brief-empathy-ledger-integration.json
**Cultural Sensitivity**: ⚠️ FLAGGED - Requires community review before article

**Summary**: Created comprehensive brief on Empathy Ledger integration covering:
- Three-tier consent model (Private → Community → Public)
- Cultural safety features (Elder approval, warnings, sensitivity levels)
- Indigenous data sovereignty principles in practice
- How it works for storytellers, organizations, and readers
- Story types that may appear through integration
- Extensive tone guidance for sensitive topic

**Technical Research**:
- Reviewed actual Empathy Ledger integration code (src/lib/supabase/empathy-ledger.ts)
- Documented real consent fields: privacy_level, is_public, requires_elder_approval
- Captured cultural safety features: cultural_warnings, cultural_sensitivity_level
- Noted Indigenous-controlled organization handling

**Review Requirements**:
- ⚠️ First Nations team review REQUIRED
- ⚠️ Community partner approval recommended
- ⚠️ Technical accuracy check against current implementation

**Learnings**:
- For culturally sensitive content, explain WHY review is needed, not just that it is
- Technical documentation helps ensure accuracy when translating to plain language
- Flagging content as requiring community review upfront prevents awkward corrections later
