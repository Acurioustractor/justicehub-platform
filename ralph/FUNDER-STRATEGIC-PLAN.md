# JusticeHub Funder Strategic Plan

**Prepared:** January 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Investment Ready
**Compiled by:** Comprehensive Site Audit (48+ pages reviewed)

---

## Executive Summary

JusticeHub represents Australia's most comprehensive digital platform for youth justice reform, combining evidence-based intelligence, community storytelling, and Aboriginal-led governance. This strategic plan synthesizes findings from a comprehensive audit of 48+ pages across 12 platform sections.

### The Opportunity

Australia's youth justice system costs **$1.212M per detained youth** annually with **84% reoffending rates**. Meanwhile, community-led programs like Oonchiumpa demonstrate **95% success rates** at a fraction of the cost. JusticeHub bridges this gap by:

1. **Documenting what works** - 1,003 interventions across all 8 states
2. **Amplifying community voices** - 39 published stories, media sentiment tracking
3. **Enabling evidence-based decisions** - ALMA AI-powered intelligence system
4. **Building a national network** - 9 nodes forming across Australia and NZ

### Investment Ask

| Scenario | Amount | Duration | Key Outcome |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| BASE | $10.5M | 3 years | 29 communities reached, 48% Indigenous workforce |
| NETWORK | $15.2M | 3 years | 45 communities, national coverage |
| SCALE | $22.8M | 5 years | ACCO transition, self-sustaining by Year 5 |

### Why Now

- **Royal Commission accountability gap** - 387 recommendations, minimal implementation tracking
- **$847K+ per youth in detention** - Growing cost pressure on states
- **Community solutions proven** - Evidence base established but fragmented
- **Technology ready** - $303K platform value already built and operational
