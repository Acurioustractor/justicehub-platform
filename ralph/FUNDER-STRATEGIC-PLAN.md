# JusticeHub Funder Strategic Plan

**Prepared by:** Ralph (Autonomous Task Agent)
**Date:** January 7, 2026
**Version:** 2.0
**Based on:** Comprehensive 48-page site audit across 12 sections

---

## Executive Summary

JusticeHub is Australia's first comprehensive youth justice intelligence platform, transforming how communities, funders, researchers, and policymakers access and share evidence about what works for young people in the justice system. Built on principles of Aboriginal Community Control and radical transparency, JusticeHub combines a living database of 951+ interventions with storytelling, ALMA AI intelligence, and community-owned governance models.

### The Opportunity

Australia faces a youth justice crisis:
- **24x overrepresentation** of Indigenous youth in detention
- **$1.1M annual cost** per detained young person vs **$58K** for community programs
- **84% reoffending rate** from detention vs **3-81%** success rates from community programs
- **387 recommendations** from major inquiries remain largely unimplemented

JusticeHub addresses this by providing the evidence infrastructure that enables funders, governments, and communities to invest in what actually works.

### Key Investment Highlights

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Documented Interventions | 951 | Intelligence Hub |
| Registered Organizations | 467 | Network Directory |

| Community Programs Curated | 10 (81% avg success) | Grassroots Database |
| Impact Dashboard Programs | 1,003 | Stewards Impact |
| International Models Documented | 16 | Global Map |

### Platform Value Already Created: $303K

JusticeHub is not vaporware. The platform is live, functional, and demonstrates significant investment-readiness with comprehensive documentation prepared for the Mindaroo Foundation ($10.5M ask).
