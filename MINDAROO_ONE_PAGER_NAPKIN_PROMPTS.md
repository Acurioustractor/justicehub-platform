## Visualization 1: Indigenous Youth Justice Gap

### Prompt to Paste:

```
The Indigenous Youth Justice Gap

Indigenous young people are detained at 17 times the rate of non-Indigenous young people.

DETENTION RATES (per 10,000 youth aged 10-17):
- Indigenous young people: 34.2 per 10,000
- Non-Indigenous young people: 2.0 per 10,000
- Ratio: 17:1 overrepresentation

DETENTION POPULATION COMPOSITION:
- Indigenous young people: 54% of those in detention (but only 5.5% of general youth population)
- Non-Indigenous young people: 46% of those in detention (but 94.5% of general youth population)

Key regional disparities (rates per 10,000):
- Northern Territory: 91.8 (Indigenous) vs 3.8 (non-Indigenous) = 24x
- Western Australia: 52.7 vs 2.1 = 25x
- Queensland: 38.1 vs 1.9 = 20x
- New South Wales: 26.4 vs 1.7 = 16x
- South Australia: 22.3 vs 1.5 = 15x
- Victoria: 14.2 vs 1.2 = 12x

Data source: AIHW Youth Justice Report 2023-24

Visual style: Show two bar charts side by side - one showing detention RATES per 10,000, another showing percentage COMPOSITION of detention population. Include Australia map with regional heatmap showing overrepresentation ratios. Use yellow for emphasis on main 17x statistic.

## Quick Tips

1. **Remove Emojis First:** Napkin AI may auto-add emojis - delete them immediately
2. **Use Color Picker:** Apply exact hex codes from the Mindaroo palette
3. **Simplify Command:** If too decorative, ask Napkin to "make it more minimal"
4. **Public Sans Font:** Try to use Public Sans font if available in Napkin AI
5. **Export Settings:**
   - SVG for web/documents (scales perfectly)
   - PNG at 2x for presentations
   - Use transparent background option

## Where to Save Files

Save all exported visuals to: `/public/figma-exports/mindaroo-visuals/`

Then reference in MDX documents using:
```jsx
<Image src="/figma-exports/mindaroo-visuals/mindaroo-justice-gap-infographic.svg" />
```

---

## Integration with One-Pager

Once created, these visuals replace the "VISUALIZATION PROMPT" sections in:
[`/src/app/wiki/mindaroo-pitch/one-pager/page.mdx`](/src/app/wiki/mindaroo-pitch/one-pager/page.mdx)

Replace the text prompts with:
```jsx
<div className="my-8">
  <Image
    src="/figma-exports/mindaroo-visuals/[filename].svg"
    alt="[description]"
    width={1200}
    height={800}
    className="rounded-lg shadow-lg"
  />
</div>
```
