- Shows category distribution
- Identifies services needing improvement
- Provides statistics

**Usage**:
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS='--require dotenv/config' npx tsx src/scripts/review-service-categories.ts
```

### 4. `service-data-quality.ts`
Generates data quality reports
- Field completeness percentages
- Category quality metrics
