## 📊 Budget Principles Across All Scenarios

**1. Community Compensation is Sacred**
- LEAN: $433K total per community over 3 years ($143K average annually)
- BASE: $587K total per community over 3 years ($180K average annually) ⭐
- UPPER: $700K total per community over 3 years ($225K average annually)

**Community payments are highest percentage in each budget - this is intentional**

**2. Indigenous Capacity Building = Cost Reduction**
- Trainees → Developers transformation happens in all scenarios
- Tech Lead role eliminated by Year 3 in all scenarios
- Staff costs reduce through community capacity in all scenarios
- Percentage reduction: LEAN 15%, BASE 20%, UPPER 26%

**3. Realistic Revenue Timelines**
- Year 3 revenue: LEAN $20K, BASE $60K, UPPER $100K
- Year 5 revenue: LEAN $100K, BASE $250-400K, UPPER $500-800K
- Year 8+ revenue: LEAN $300K, BASE $800K-1.5M, UPPER $1.5M-2.5M
- Social enterprises take 7-10 years to mature

**4. A Curious Tractor Overhead = Sustainable Delivery**
- Consistently 11-12% across all scenarios
- Not profit margin - organizational sustainability
- Complex systems-change requires dedicated infrastructure
- Ensures non-extractive, accountable project management

**5. Quality Over Quantity**
- BASE scenario is the "sweet spot" - right-sized for impact
- LEAN proves the model with less risk
- UPPER maximizes scale for those ready for bold investment
