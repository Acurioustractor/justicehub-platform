## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Run `FIX_COURT_AND_CRIMES_TABLES.sql` to fix remaining tables
2. Re-run loader to get court and police data
3. Build dashboard to visualize this data
4. Set up automated updates

## 💡 Why This Matters

With just the data we've loaded, we can already prove:
- Indigenous youth are grossly overrepresented (16x)
- The government spends 92% on detention that doesn't work
- Only 8% goes to community programs that could prevent crime

This is exactly the evidence needed to drive reform.
