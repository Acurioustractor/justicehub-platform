## Key Evidence Highlights

### The Crisis

<Callout type="error" title="Overrepresentation">
  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are **17 times more likely** to be in detention than non-Indigenous young people.
</Callout>

**The costs:**
- **$1,500+ per night** for youth detention in Australia
- **$5.1M annually** for a community like Bourke before justice reinvestment
- **30-40% of practitioner time** spent writing unsuccessful grants
- **Perpetual philanthropic dependency** with no pathway to self-sufficiency

### What Works

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">
  <Callout type="success" title="Bourke Justice Reinvestment">
    **79% reduction** in youth detention over 10 years

    **$4M saved annually** in detention costs

    **ROI: $2.22** saved for every $1 invested
  </Callout>

  <Callout type="success" title="New Zealand - Oranga Tamariki">
    **60% reduction** in Māori youth in custody (2010-2020)

    **Community-led** diversion programs with cultural protocols

    **National framework** for Indigenous data sovereignty
  </Callout>
</div>

## International Best Practices

### 1. New Zealand - Oranga Tamariki

<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-6">
  <StatCard value="60%" label="Reduction in Māori youth custody" color="green" size="sm" trend="down" />
  <StatCard value="2010-2020" label="Timeframe" color="blue" size="sm" />
  <StatCard value="$250M" label="Annual investment" color="purple" size="sm" />
</div>

**Key lessons:**
- Māori-led family group conferencing
- Cultural healing integrated into justice responses
- National Indigenous data sovereignty framework
- Community-controlled decision-making
- Sustained government investment over 10+ years

### 2. Canada - Gladue Principles

**Key innovation:** Sentencing framework considering Indigenous background, trauma, and systemic factors

**Impact:**
- Alternative sentencing options for Indigenous youth
- Community-based healing programs
- Reduced incarceration rates in pilot communities

### 3. USA - Tribal Youth Program

**Approach:** Tribal communities designing and delivering their own youth justice programs

**Results:**
- 40-60% reduction in recidivism
- Culturally-grounded interventions
- Youth engaged in cultural activities, language, land

### 4. Colombia - Indigenous Justice Systems

**Recognition:** Indigenous communities' authority to administer justice according to their own laws

**Outcomes:**
- Lower recidivism than state system
- Community healing and restoration prioritized
- Cultural preservation and sovereignty strengthened

### 5. Norway - Youth Care Homes

**Model:** Small, home-like environments with therapeutic support

**Results:**
- 20% recidivism rate (vs 60-70% in prison-like facilities)
- Focus on rehabilitation, education, mental health
- Young people maintain family connections

## Evidence on Grant Writing Burden

<Callout type="warning" title="The Hidden Cost">
  Practitioners spend **30-40% of their time** writing unsuccessful grant applications, diverting resources from service delivery.
</Callout>

**Academic sources:**
- Nonprofit Quarterly (2022): "The Grant Writing Trap" - 35% of time on average
- Stanford Social Innovation Review (2021): Overhead costs including grant writing 25-40%
- Australian Council of Social Service (2020): 30% average for small community organizations

**What this means:**
- $300K salary = $90-120K lost to grant writing
- Time not spent working with young people
- Perpetual insecurity and short-term planning
- Extractive relationships with funders

**JusticeHub solution:** Revenue-generating platform reduces dependency on grants

## Data Sovereignty Framework

<Callout type="info" title="Indigenous Data Sovereignty">
  Indigenous peoples' right to control collection, ownership, and application of data about their communities, lands, and resources.
</Callout>

**CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance:**
- **C**ollective Benefit - Data used for collective Indigenous benefit
- **A**uthority to Control - Indigenous control over data ecosystems
- **R**esponsibility - How data reflects relationships and obligations
- **E**thics - Minimizing harm, maximizing benefit

**JusticeHub Implementation:**
- Layered consent system (individual, family, community, nation)
- Community-controlled data access
- Cultural protocols embedded in platform
- Revenue sharing from data use

## Revenue Models for Sustainability

<Callout type="tip" title="Realistic Timeline">
  Social enterprises typically take **7-10 years** to reach 50-70% self-sustainability. Our projections are based on this evidence.
</Callout>

**Proven revenue streams for Indigenous social enterprises:**
1. **Membership subscriptions** - Organizations paying for platform access
2. **Training contracts** - Government and NGOs paying for practitioner training
3. **Consulting services** - Evaluation, program design, best practice advice
4. **Licensing** - International replication in other jurisdictions
5. **Data products** - Anonymized, aggregated insights (with community consent)

**JusticeHub projections:**
- Year 3: $30-60K (building proof of value)
- Year 5: $250-400K (35-50% self-sustaining)
- Year 7: $400-600K (50-70% self-sustaining)
- Year 8+: 75-85% self-sustaining
