# Product Requirements Document: JusticeHub Platform

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1. Overview
JusticeHub is a next-generation youth empowerment platform designed to bridge the gap between young people's life experiences and opportunities for growth, mentorship, and economic advancement. The platform's core is the "Living Libraries" initiative, which empowers youth to share their stories.

### 1.2. Vision
Our vision is to create a unified, scalable, and secure platform that seamlessly integrates existing story collections from Airtable with new, dynamic content created by users. By combining powerful storytelling with tangible opportunities, JusticeHub will become an essential tool for youth, mentors, and partner organizations, fostering a supportive ecosystem for personal and professional development.

### 1.3. Goals
- **Unify Storytelling:** Integrate the rich, existing repository of stories from Airtable into the main platform, providing users with a single, seamless discovery experience.
- **Empower Youth:** Provide young users with modern tools to create, share, and control their own multimedia stories.
- **Foster Connections:** Build a robust Mentor Hub to connect youth with experienced mentors for guidance and support.
- **Create Opportunity:** Develop an Opportunity Matching engine that connects youth with relevant apprenticeships, jobs, and other growth opportunities provided by partner organizations.
- **Provide Insight:** Deliver actionable analytics through the "Empathy Ledger" to help organizations understand their impact and user engagement.

## 2. Target Audience

- **Youth Users:** Young individuals (ages 14-24) seeking support, community, mentorship, and opportunities. They are the primary content creators and consumers.
- **Mentors:** Vetted adults who volunteer their time to provide guidance, support, and encouragement to youth users.
- **Partner Organizations:** Non-profits, community groups, and corporations that provide opportunities, sponsor programs, and manage cohorts of users.
- **Platform Administrators:** Internal team responsible for managing the platform, ensuring its security, and overseeing all user activity.

## 3. Core Features & Requirements

### 3.1. Living Libraries: Unified Story Management

#### User Stories
- **As a user, I want to** browse, search, and filter a comprehensive collection of stories, regardless of whether they originate from the new platform or the existing Airtable database.
- **As a youth user, I want to** create a rich, multimedia story using text, images, and video, and have granular control over its visibility.
- **As a user, I want to** see clear attribution on stories, so I know their source (e.g., "From our Airtable Archive" or "Shared by a JusticeHub Member").
- **As a platform administrator, I want to** manage the synchronization process with Airtable to ensure data freshness and integrity.

#### Functional Requirements
- The platform must display a combined feed of stories from both the local PostgreSQL database and the Airtable database.
- A robust search functionality must allow querying across all story content, including titles, body text, and tags.
- Filtering options must include source (local/Airtable), story type, and tags.
- Youth users must have a story editor that supports rich text and media uploads (stored in AWS S3).
- Privacy controls for stories must include: Public, Organization-Only, Mentors-Only, and Anonymous.

### 3.2. Airtable MCP Integration

#### Functional Requirements
- A dedicated, standalone MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server will act as the sole bridge to the Airtable API.
- The MCP server must provide the following tools for the main application to use:
  - `get_stories`: Retrieve stories with advanced filtering.
  - `get_story_by_id`: Fetch a single story by its Airtable record ID.
  - `search_stories`: Perform full-text search.
  - `get_stories_by_tag`: Retrieve stories associated with specific tags.
  - `get_story_metadata`: Aggregate metadata for analytics.
- A data transformation layer must exist to map Airtable records to the platform's unified story model.
- A Redis caching layer must be implemented within the MCP server to reduce latency and minimize direct API calls to Airtable.
- The main API will have dedicated endpoints (`/api/airtable/*`) to proxy requests to the MCP server.

### 3.3. User & Organization Management

#### User Stories
- **As a new user, I want to** securely register and create a profile for my role (Youth, Mentor).
- **As a user, I want to** log in and out of the platform securely.
- **As an organization administrator, I want to** manage the profiles of users associated with my organization.

#### Functional Requirements
- Authentication will be managed via Auth0.
- The system must support role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict features based on user roles (Youth, Mentor, OrgAdmin, PlatformAdmin).
- The database schema must support multi-tenancy for organizations.

### 3.4. Mentor Hub & Opportunity Matching

#### User Stories
- **As a youth user, I want to** search for mentors based on skills and interests and request a connection.
- **As a mentor, I want to** set up a profile, define my availability, and accept mentorship requests.
- **As an organization, I want to** post, manage, and track opportunities (e.g., apprenticeships, jobs).
- **As a youth user, I want to** see a list of opportunities that are a good match for my profile and skills.

#### Functional Requirements
- A matching algorithm will be developed to score and recommend opportunities to youth users.
- The system must manage the lifecycle of mentorship relationships (request, active, ended).
- Organizations must have a dashboard to manage their posted opportunities.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** API endpoints should have a median response time of <200ms. Cached story feeds should load in <1 second.
- **Scalability:** The architecture must be a "microservices-ready monolith," allowing individual services (e.g., User Service, Story Service) to be extracted and scaled independently in the future.
- **Security:** All data must be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest. The platform must adhere to security best practices to protect user data, including protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
- **Observability:** The system must have comprehensive logging, monitoring (CloudWatch), and tracing (X-Ray) for both the main application and the MCP server.
- **Reliability:** The platform should have an uptime of 99.9%.
