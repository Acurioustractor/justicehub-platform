## Abstract (298 words)

### JusticeHub: A Community-Powered Platform for Youth Justice Transformation

Communities have always known the way. For decades, grassroots organisations, Aboriginal Community Controlled services, and dedicated practitioners have demonstrated that young people thrive when supported through connection, culture, and community rather than confinement. JusticeHub exists to amplify this truth.

JusticeHub is Australia's first community intelligence platform bringing together evidence, stories, and resources that demonstrate what communities have long understood: community-based approaches produce better outcomes than custody. With detention costing $3,320 per day compared to $150 for community programs, and rates of return to custody sitting at 84.5% for detention versus 20-40% for community-based support, the data confirms what families and communities experience daily.

At the heart of JusticeHub is ALMA (Authentic Learning for Meaningful Accountability), an intelligence system designed with and for communities. ALMA collects and connects fragmented evidence across jurisdictions, translates between the language of lived experience and policy, and surfaces patterns that support advocacy efforts. Critically, ALMA operates within strict cultural protocols, adhering to OCAP (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession) principles and ensuring communities maintain sovereignty over their knowledge.

JusticeHub addresses digital inclusion by creating accessible pathways for communities to contribute their stories, evidence, and program outcomes. The platform centres storytelling as a form of evidence, recognising that healing narratives and community voices carry weight alongside traditional research.

This presentation will demonstrate how JusticeHub operates as a practical tool for advocacy, enabling communities to access evidence, calculate the true cost of policy choices, and connect with services and practitioners across the country. We will share how the platform was developed in partnership with community, the ethical frameworks guiding its evolution, and how attendees can engage with or contribute to this growing knowledge commons.

## Presenter Bios

### Kristy Bloomfield – Oonchiumpa Services (247 words)

Kristy Bloomfield is a visionary leader and Co-Founder and Director of Oonchiumpa Consultancy and Services, an Aboriginal community-controlled organisation based in Mparntwe (Alice Springs). A traditional owner with deep cultural authority, Kristy leads Oonchiumpa's work across seven language groups within a 150km radius of Alice Springs, building partnerships with over 32 organisations throughout Central Australia.

Kristy's leadership is grounded in her own family's history of resistance and protection. She carries the stories of her grandmother, an Alyawarra woman who fought to keep her children from being removed, and her grandfather, a Stolen Generations survivor. These experiences of intergenerational strength inform how Oonchiumpa approaches its work with young people today.

Under Kristy's guidance, Oonchiumpa has achieved a 95% reduction in anti-social behaviour among the young people they support, alongside 72% school re-engagement rates. Through programs including cultural camps at Atnarpa Homestead, the True Justice partnership with ANU, and cultural brokerage services, Kristy creates pathways for young people to connect with identity, country, and purpose.

Kristy believes that young people who have contact with the criminal legal system are not problems to be solved but bearers of possibility. Her approach centres cultural connection as the foundation for healing, offering young people the chance to see themselves reflected in positive representations of Aboriginal achievement while building skills to navigate contemporary realities.

"Connection to culture, country, and elders is the foundation of healing."

### Tanya Turner – Oonchiumpa Services (248 words)

Tanya Turner is a proud Aboriginal woman from Central Australia and Co-Founder and Director of Oonchiumpa Consultancy and Services. Her journey reflects resilience and determination, bringing together expertise in Indigenous justice, legal practice, and community development to create culturally-led pathways for young people in Mparntwe (Alice Springs).

Tanya's professional background spans the Supreme Court of Victoria, remote community legal work, child protection advocacy, and family mediation, where she has achieved a 95% success rate. This diverse experience has led her to a clear understanding: justice emerges through relationship, not merely through proper application of legal principles.

At Oonchiumpa, Tanya practices cultural brokerage, helping young people navigate complex systems while strengthening their cultural identity. She describes this as twofold work: empowering young people in their identity as Aboriginal people, making them feel strong and proud, while also bridging the gap between cultural knowledge and the Western world.

Tanya conducts cultural awareness sessions with health professionals and service providers, helping them understand the historical contexts that shape contemporary realities. She believes that supporting young people requires acknowledging the broader stories that have shaped their families and communities, not to burden them with historical trauma, but to help them locate their experiences within contexts that make sense.

Through her work, Tanya has witnessed young people who were defined by systems as "problems" reveal themselves as leaders, mentors, and knowledge-holders when given the right opportunities and support.

"Our young people need to know they are valued – not by the system, but by their own mob."

### Ben Knight – A Curious Tractor (248 words)

Ben Knight is the founder of A Curious Tractor (ACT), a regenerative innovation organisation working at the intersection of technology, community development, and social change. Through ACT, Ben leads the development of JusticeHub and ALMA (Authentic Learning for Meaningful Accountability), platforms designed to support communities advocating for young people who have experienced contact with the criminal legal system.

Ben's approach centres on listening first and building second. His methodology, LCAA (Listen, Curiosity, Action, Art), reflects a commitment to ensuring technology serves community needs rather than extracting from them. This philosophy shapes JusticeHub's design for obsolescence model, where the ultimate goal is community ownership and self-determination.

With a background spanning technology development and community engagement, Ben brings a practical understanding of how digital tools can either empower or exclude. His work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities has deepened his commitment to data sovereignty and cultural protocols, principles embedded throughout JusticeHub's architecture.

Ben is particularly focused on demonstrating alternatives to punitive approaches for young people, believing that evidence-based advocacy can shift policy and practice toward community-centred models. He sees JusticeHub not as a solution but as a tool that communities can use to tell their own stories and advocate for the changes they know are needed.

When not building platforms, Ben can be found learning from community practitioners, exploring how art and creativity support healing, and advocating for approaches that recognise the inherent worth and potential of every young person.
