# Profile Display Implementation: COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Empathy Ledger profiles now display on JusticeHub service and program pages

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ProfileCard Component ✅

Created a reusable component to display Empathy Ledger profiles with:
- Profile picture (or default gradient avatar)
- Name (preferred_name or fallback to name)
- Role/relationship to the service/program
- Bio or story excerpt (150 character preview)
- Organization affiliation
- Cultural warnings (when applicable)
- Featured badge
- Link to full story on Empathy Ledger platform

**File**: `src/components/ProfileCard.tsx`

**Features**:
- Respects cultural sensitivity settings
- Shows cultural warnings when present
- Opens full profile on Empathy Ledger platform
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Consistent with JusticeHub's bold, truth-telling design system

### 2. Service Detail Page Integration ✅

Updated `/services/[id]/page.tsx` to:
- Fetch linked profiles from API
- Display "Real People, Real Impact" section
- Show 1-3 profile cards per row (responsive grid)
- Include Empathy Ledger attribution
- Only show section when profiles exist

**What Users See**:
```
Real People, Real Impact
Hear from people who have used this service and their experiences.

[Profile Card] [Profile Card] [Profile Card]

ℹ️ These stories are shared through Empathy Ledger, an Indigenous-led
   storytelling platform that maintains data sovereignty and cultural
   protocols. All stories are shared with explicit consent.
```

### 3. Community Program Page Integration ✅

Updated `/community-programs/[id]/page.tsx` to:
- Fetch participant profiles from API
- Display "Hear from Participants" section
- Beautiful gradient background (blue-to-purple)
- Show participant transformation stories
- Include cultural protocol attribution

**What Users See**:
```
Hear from Participants
Real stories from young people who have been part of this transformative program.

[Profile Card] [Profile Card] [Profile Card]

ℹ️ About these stories: Shared through Empathy Ledger, an Indigenous-led
   storytelling platform. All stories honor cultural protocols, maintain
   data sovereignty, and are shared with explicit consent from storytellers.
```

### 4. API Routes Created ✅

**Service Profiles API**: `/api/services/[id]/profiles/route.ts`
- Fetches all profile appearances for a service
- Returns full profile data from Empathy Ledger
- Handles errors gracefully

**Program Profiles API**: `/api/programs/[id]/profiles/route.ts`
- Fetches all profile appearances for a program
- Returns participant stories
- Consistent error handling

Both APIs use server-side integration functions from `src/lib/integrations/profile-linking.ts`.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
✅ `src/components/ProfileCard.tsx` - Reusable profile display component
✅ `src/app/api/services/[id]/profiles/route.ts` - Service profiles API
✅ `src/app/api/programs/[id]/profiles/route.ts` - Program profiles API

### Modified Files
✅ `src/app/services/[id]/page.tsx` - Added profile display section
✅ `src/app/community-programs/[id]/page.tsx` - Added participant stories section

## Current Live Data

Based on the sync completed earlier, we now have:
- **12 profile appearances** in the database
- **10 unique Empathy Ledger profiles** linked
- **8 services** with real people's stories
- **0 programs** with profiles (ready to link manually)

### Sample Services with Profiles

8 services now show real participant stories:
```
Service: 5a34ad50... (1 profile)
Service: a6ab5f82... (2 profiles)
Service: c29d4de8... (1 profile)
Service: 2b37df23... (3 profiles) ← Most popular!
Service: 68d8ab9f... (1 profile)
Service: 36ea7e2b... (1 profile)
Service: 23215c1f... (1 profile)
Service: 0c32279f... (2 profiles)
```

## How It Works

### User Journey

1. **User browses services** → `/services`
2. **User clicks on a service** → `/services/[id]`
3. **Page loads**:
   - Service details fetch from JusticeHub database
   - Profiles fetch from `/api/services/[id]/profiles`
   - API calls `getProfilesFor('service', serviceId)` from integration layer
   - Integration layer queries `profile_appearances` table
   - For each appearance, fetches full profile from Empathy Ledger database
4. **User sees**:
   - Service information
   - Contact details
   - **NEW: Real people who used the service**
   - Stories of transformation
5. **User clicks "Read full story"** → Opens Empathy Ledger platform in new tab

### Technical Flow

```typescript
// 1. Component state
const [profiles, setProfiles] = useState<ProfileData[]>([]);

// 2. Fetch on mount
useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`/api/services/${serviceId}/profiles`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setProfiles(data.profiles));
}, [serviceId]);

// 3. API route
export async function GET(request, { params }) {
  const profiles = await getProfilesFor('service', params.id);
  return NextResponse.json({ profiles });
}

// 4. Integration function
export async function getProfilesFor(type, id) {
  // Get appearances from JusticeHub
  const appearances = await justiceHubClient
    .from('profile_appearances')
    .select('*')
    .eq('appears_on_type', type)
    .eq('appears_on_id', id);

  // Fetch full profile from Empathy Ledger
  return Promise.all(
    appearances.map(a => getProfileWithJusticeStories(a.empathy_ledger_profile_id))
  );
}

// 5. Render profiles
{profiles.map(p => (
  <ProfileCard
    profile={p.profile}
    role={p.appearanceRole}
    storyExcerpt={p.appearanceExcerpt}
    isFeatured={p.isFeatured}
  />
))}
```

## Data Sovereignty & Cultural Protocols

This implementation strictly maintains:

### ✅ OCAP® Compliance
- **Ownership**: Empathy Ledger owns the data
- **Control**: JusticeHub only references, never duplicates
- **Access**: Only public stories with explicit consent
- **Possession**: Data stays in Empathy Ledger database

### ✅ Cultural Sensitivity
- Honor `privacy_level: 'public'` requirement
- Display cultural warnings when present
- Respect `cultural_sensitivity_level` settings
- Check `has_explicit_consent` field
- Link back to Empathy Ledger for full context

### ✅ Attribution
Every profile section includes:
- Clear "Empathy Ledger" branding
- Explanation of Indigenous-led platform
- Statement about data sovereignty
- Note about explicit consent
- Link to original stories

## Testing Checklist

To verify the implementation works:

### Service Pages
- [ ] Navigate to `/services` page
- [ ] Click on one of the 8 services with profiles (check database for IDs)
- [ ] Scroll down past contact information
- [ ] Verify "Real People, Real Impact" section appears
- [ ] Verify profile cards display correctly
- [ ] Click "Read full story" link
- [ ] Verify it opens Empathy Ledger in new tab

### Program Pages

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Test service profiles API
curl http://localhost:3003/api/services/[service-id-with-profiles]/profiles

# Test program profiles API
curl http://localhost:3003/api/programs/[program-id]/profiles
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Add More Profiles)

1. **Link Remaining 48 Justice Stories**
   - 48 stories have justice themes but no service_id
   - Manually review and map to appropriate services/programs
   - Use admin function:
   ```typescript
   await createProfileAppearance({
     empathyLedgerProfileId: 'uuid',
     appearsOnType: 'service',
     appearsOnId: 'service-uuid',
     role: 'participant',
     storyExcerpt: 'Short excerpt from story',
     featured: false
   });
   ```

2. **Add Profiles to Programs**
   - Currently 0 programs have linked profiles
   - Link relevant stories to community programs
   - Feature success stories on program pages

3. **Mark Featured Stories**
   - Identify most impactful stories
   - Set `featured: true` in profile_appearances
   - These will show with featured badge

### Short-term (Enhanced Display)

4. **Profile Photos**
   - Many profiles don't have photos yet
   - Default gradient avatar works well
   - Encourage storytellers to add photos to Empathy Ledger

5. **Story Categories**
   - Group stories by impact type
   - "Education Success", "Housing Support", "Cultural Healing"
   - Filter/search by story type

6. **Statistics**
   - Show aggregate impact on service pages
   - "12 young people have shared their stories about this service"
   - "95% found the support helpful"

### Long-term (Advanced Features)

7. **Admin Interface**
   - Build JusticeHub admin panel
   - Link/unlink profiles to services
   - Set featured status
   - Preview profile cards before publishing

8. **Automatic Linking**
   - When new story added to Empathy Ledger with service_id
   - Automatically create profile_appearance
   - Webhook or scheduled sync job

9. **Search & Filter**
   - Search profiles by name, organization
   - Filter by location, program type
   - Show related profiles across services

## Impact
